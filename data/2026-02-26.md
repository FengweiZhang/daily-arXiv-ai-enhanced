Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the need for a central aggregator, but it can expose communication patterns that reveal participant identities. This work presents UnlinkableDFL, a DFL framework that combines a peer-based mixnet with fragment-based model aggregation to ensure unlinkability in fully decentralized settings. Model updates are divided into encrypted fragments, sent over separate multi-hop paths, and aggregated without using any identity information. A theoretical analysis indicates that relay and end-to-end unlinkability improve with larger mixing sets and longer paths, while convergence remains similar to standard FedAvg. A prototype implementation evaluates learning performance, latency, unlinkability, and resource usage. The results show that UnlinkableDFL converges reliably and adapts to node churn. Communication latency emerges as the main overhead, while memory and CPU usage stay moderate. These findings illustrate the balance between anonymity and system efficiency, demonstrating that strong unlinkability can be maintained in decentralized learning workflows.

Abstract: 6G is deemed as a key technology to support emerging applications with stringent requirements for highly dependable and timecritical communication. In this paper, we investigate 6G networks integrated with TSN and how to compensate for wireless stochastic behavior which involves a large intrinsic packet delay variation. We evaluate a 6G solution to reduce packet delay variation that is based on de-jittering. For this, we propose to use virtual timeslots for providing the required time-awareness. We discuss the benefits of the proposed solution while evaluating the impact of the timeslot size on the number of schedulable TSN streams.

Abstract: Network traffic analysis increasingly relies on feature-based representations to support monitoring and security in the presence of pervasive encryption. Although features are more compact than raw packet traces, their storage has become a scalability bottleneck from large-scale core networks to resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. This article investigates task-aware lossy compression strategies that reduce the storage footprint of traffic features while preserving analytics accuracy. Using website classification in core networks and device identification in IoT environments as representative use cases, we show that simple, semantics-preserving compression techniques expose stable operating regions that balance storage efficiency and task performance. These results highlight compression as a first-class design dimension in scalable network monitoring systems.

Abstract: Legacy JavaScript systems lack type safety, making maintenance risky. While TypeScript can help, manually adding types is expensive. Previous automated typing research focuses on type inference but rarely addresses type checking setup, definition generation, bug identification, or behavioral correctness at repository scale. We present AgenticTyper, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic system that addresses these gaps through iterative error correction and behavior preservation via transpilation comparison. Evaluation on two proprietary repositories (81K LOC) shows that AgenticTyper resolves all 633 initial type errors in 20 minutes, reducing manual effort from one working day.

Abstract: Developer Productivity Dashboards are essential for visualizing DevOps performance metrics such as Deployment Frequency and Change Failure Rate (DORA). However, the utility of these dashboards is frequently undermined by data reliability issues. In early iterations of our platform, ad-hoc ingestion scripts (Cron jobs) led to "silent failures," where data gaps went undetected for days, eroding organizational trust. This paper reports on our experience migrating from legacy scheduling to a robust Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipeline using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) orchestration and Medallion Architecture. We detail the operational benefits of decoupling data extraction from transformation, the necessity of immutable raw history for metric redefinition, and the implementation of state-based dependency management. Our experience suggests that treating the metrics pipeline as a production-grade distributed system is a prerequisite for sustainable engineering analytics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential as autonomous software engineering (SWE) agents. Recent work has further explored augmenting these agents with memory mechanisms to support long-horizon reasoning. However, these approaches typically operate at a coarse instance granularity, treating the entire problem-solving episode as the atomic unit of storage and retrieval. We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro). Performance gains grow with more interaction steps, showing that leveraging past experience benefits long-horizon reasoning in complex software engineering tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to a significant increase in automated tools in the software engineering, capable of performing various code-related tasks such as code generation, completion, and translation. Despite these advancements, its effectiveness is constrained by fixed context lengths, limiting its ability to generalize across long, domain-specific code sequences. To address this challenge, we investigate zero-shot, inference-only methods aimed at improving position encodings and optimizing attention mechanisms. Our goal is to provide a thorough analysis of current approaches that facilitate context length extrapolation in code, particularly in the context of long code completion tasks.

Abstract: LLM agents have been widely adopted in real-world applications, relying on agent frameworks for workflow execution and multi-agent coordination. As these systems scale, understanding bugs in the underlying agent frameworks becomes critical. However, existing work mainly focuses on agent-level failures, overlooking framework-level bugs. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study of 998 bug reports from CrewAI and LangChain, constructing a taxonomy of 15 root causes and 7 observable symptoms across five agent lifecycle stages: 'Agent Initialization','Perception', 'Self-Action', 'Mutual Interaction' and 'Evolution'. Our findings show that agent framework bugs mainly arise from 'API misuse', 'API incompatibility', and 'Documentation Desync', largely concentrated in the 'Self-Action' stage. Symptoms typically appear as 'Functional Error', 'Crash', and 'Build Failure', reflecting disruptions to task progression and control flow.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for automated code refactoring tasks. Although these models can quickly refactor code, the quality may exhibit inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior. In this article, we systematically study the capabilities of LLMs for code refactoring with a specific focus on improving code readability.
  We conducted a large-scale experiment using GPT5.1 with 230 Java snippets, each systematically varied and refactored regarding code readability across five iterations under three different prompting strategies. We categorized fine-grained code changes during the refactoring into implementation, syntactic, and comment-level transformations. Subsequently, we investigated the functional correctness and tested the robustness of the results with novel snippets.
  Our results reveal three main insights: First, iterative code refactoring exhibits an initial phase of restructuring followed by stabilization. This convergence tendency suggests that LLMs possess an internalized understanding of an "optimally readable" version of code. Second, convergence patterns are fairly robust across different code variants. Third, explicit prompting toward specific readability factors slightly influences the refactoring dynamics.
  These insights provide an empirical foundation for assessing the reliability of LLM-assisted code refactoring, which opens pathways for future research, including comparative analyses across models and a systematic evaluation of additional software quality dimensions in LLM-refactored code.

Abstract: Automated test generation is essential for software quality assurance, with coverage rate serving as a key metric to ensure thorough testing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving test generation, particularly in achieving higher coverage. However, while existing LLM-based test generation solutions perform well on small, isolated code snippets, they struggle when applied to complex methods under test. To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods.

Abstract: Integrated Development Environments shape developers' daily experience, yet the empirical study of their usability and user experience (UX) remains limited. This work presents an LLM-assisted approach to detecting UX smells in Visual Studio Code by mining and classifying user-reported issues from the GitHub repository. Using a validated taxonomy and expert review, we identified recurring UX problems that affect the developer experience. Our results show that the majority of UX smells are concentrated in informativeness, clarity, intuitiveness, and efficiency, qualities that developers value most.

Abstract: This paper explains the Visual Milestone Planning (VMP) method using an agile vocabulary to facilitate its adoption by agile practitioners as a front end for a hybrid development process. VMP is a visual and collaborative planning approach which promotes a shared understanding of the work approach and commitment through the direct manipulation by team members of the reified planning constructs involved in the development of the plan. Once the product backlog has been established and relevant milestones identified, a novel construct called the milestone planning matrix is used to document the allocation of product backlog items to milestones. The milestones due dates are later determined by grouping sticky notes representing the work to be performed into time-boxes called work packages and accommodating them on a resource and time scaled scheduling canvas very much as it would be done in a Tetris game.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in cost, latency, and adaptability, but have so far lagged behind larger models on long-horizon software engineering tasks such as SWE-bench, where they suffer from pervasive action looping and low resolution rates. We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop a topological lens on relational schema design by encoding functional dependencies (FDs) as simplices of an abstract simplicial complex. This dependency complex exposes multi-attribute interactions and enables homological invariants (Betti numbers) to diagnose cyclic dependency structure. We define Simplicial Normal Form (SNF) as homological acyclicity of the dependency complex in positive dimensions, i.e., vanishing reduced homology for all $n \ge 1$. SNF is intentionally weaker than contractibility and does not identify homology with homotopy. For decompositions, we give a topological reformulation of the classical binary lossless-join criterion: assuming dependency preservation, a decomposition is lossless exactly when the intersection attributes form a key for at least one component. Topologically, this yields a strong deformation retraction that trivializes the relevant Mayer--Vietoris boundary map. For multiway decompositions, we show how the nerve of a cover by induced subcomplexes provides a computable certificate: a 1-cycle in the nerve (detected by $H_1$) obstructs join-tree structure and aligns with cyclic join behavior in acyclic-scheme theory. Finally, we discuss an algorithmic consequence: Betti numbers of the dependency complex (or of a decomposition nerve) can be computed from boundary matrices and used as a lightweight schema diagnostic to localize "unexplained" dependency cycles, complementing standard FD-chase tests.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern cost-based DBMSs frequently exhibit execution instability and tail-latency amplification when high-dimensional relational operations trigger memory-regime transitions such as hash-table spilling and external materialization. We identify a structural failure mode in which intermediate representations are prematurely linearized under memory pressure, causing disproportionate I/O amplification and phase-transition-like latency behavior. To mitigate this, we propose a tensor-based execution path that delays premature linearization and preserves higher-dimensional locality through late materialization and structured intermediate layouts. Using a modified PostgreSQL-based prototype and controlled microbenchmarks, we show that under constrained memory settings (e.g., work_mem=1MB) conventional execution can spill hundreds of megabytes and exceed multi-second P99 latency, while the proposed path maintains stable execution and reduces P99 latency to sub-second levels. Our results suggest that representation timing is a first-class design variable for execution stability, complementing traditional optimization efforts focused on cardinality estimation and operator throughput.

Abstract: The fastest indexes for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search today are also the slowest to build: graph-based methods like HNSW and Vamana achieve state-of-the-art query performance but have large construction times due to relying on random-access-heavy beam searches. We introduce PiPNN (Pick-in-Partitions Nearest Neighbors), an ultra-scalable graph construction algorithm that avoids this ``search bottleneck'' that existing graph-based methods suffer from.
  PiPNN's core innovation is HashPrune, a novel online pruning algorithm which dynamically maintains sparse collections of edges. HashPrune enables PiPNN to partition the dataset into overlapping sub-problems, efficiently perform bulk distance comparisons via dense matrix multiplication kernels, and stream a subset of the edges into HashPrune. HashPrune guarantees bounded memory during index construction which permits PiPNN to build higher quality indices without the use of extra intermediate memory.
  PiPNN builds state-of-the-art indexes up to 11.6x faster than Vamana (DiskANN) and up to 12.9x faster than HNSW. PiPNN is significantly more scalable than recent algorithms for fast graph construction. PiPNN builds indexes at least 19.1x faster than MIRAGE and 17.3x than FastKCNA while producing indexes that achieve higher query throughput. PiPNN enables us to build, for the first time, high-quality ANN indexes on billion-scale datasets in under 20 minutes using a single multicore machine.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Streaming graph partitioners enable resource-efficient and massively scalable partitioning, but one-pass assignment heuristics are highly sensitive to stream order and often yield substantially higher edge cuts than in-memory methods. We present BuffCut, a buffered streaming partitioner that narrows this quality gap, particularly when stream ordering is adversarial, by combining prioritized buffering with batch-wise multilevel assignment. BuffCut maintains a bounded priority buffer to delay poorly informed decisions and regulate the order in which nodes are considered for assignment. It incrementally constructs high-locality batches of configurable size by iteratively inserting the highest-priority nodes from the buffer into the batch, effectively recovering locality structure from the stream. Each batch is then assigned via a multilevel partitioning algorithm. Experiments on diverse real-world and synthetic graphs show that BuffCut consistently outperforms state-of-the-art buffered streaming methods. Compared to the strongest prioritized buffering baseline, BuffCut achieves 20.8% fewer edge cuts while running 2.9 times faster and using 11.3 times less memory. Against the next-best buffered method, it reduces edge cut by 15.8% with only modest overheads of 1.8 times runtime and 1.09 times memory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Effective data processing depends on the quality of the underlying data. However, quality issues such as inconsistencies and uncertainties, can significantly impede the processing and subsequent use of data. Despite the centrality of data quality to a wide range of computational tasks, there is currently no broadly accepted, domain-independent consensus on the definition of data quality. Existing frameworks primarily define data quality in ways that are tailored to specific domains, data types, or contexts of use. Although quality assessment frameworks exist for specific domains, such as electronic health record data and linked data, corresponding approaches for descriptive information about cultural heritage objects remain underdeveloped. Moreover, existing quality definitions are often theoretical in nature and lack empirical validation based on real-world data problems. In this paper, we address these limitations by first defining a set of quality dimensions specifically designed to capture the characteristics of descriptive information about cultural heritage objects. Our definition is based on an in-depth analysis of existing dimensions and is illustrated through domain-specific examples. We then evaluate the practical applicability of our proposed quality definition using a curated set of real-world data quality problems from the cultural heritage domain. This empirical evaluation substantiates our definition of data quality, resulting in a comprehensive definition of data quality in this domain.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-SQL and Big Data are both extensively benchmarked fields, yet there is limited research that evaluates them jointly. In the real world, Text-to-SQL systems are often embedded with Big Data workflows, such as large-scale data processing or interactive data analytics. We refer to this as "Text-to-Big SQL". However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.
  In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data. In contrast, our proposed text-to-Big SQL metrics accurately reflect execution efficiency, cost, and the impact of data scale. Furthermore, we provide LLM-specific insights, including fine-grained, cross-model comparisons of latency and cost.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search on SSD-backed indexes is increasingly I/O-bound (I/O accounts for 70--90\% of query latency). We present an I/O-first framework for disk-based ANN that organizes techniques along three dimensions: memory layout, disk layout, and search algorithm. We introduce a page-level complexity model that explains how page locality and path length jointly determine page reads, and we validate the model empirically. Using consistent implementations across four public datasets, we quantify both single-factor effects and cross-dimensional synergies. We find that (i) memory-resident navigation and dynamic width provide the strongest standalone gains; (ii) page shuffle and page search are weak alone but complementary together; and (iii) a principled composition, OctopusANN, substantially reduces I/O and achieves 4.1--37.9\% higher throughput than the state-of-the-art system Starling and 87.5--149.5\% higher throughput than DiskANN at matched Recall@10=90\%. Finally, we distill actionable guidelines for selecting storage-centric or hybrid designs across diverse concurrency levels and accuracy constraints, advocating systematic composition rather than isolated tweaks when pushing the performance frontier of disk-based ANN.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Model (LLM) services faces significant cost and latency challenges, making effective caching under tight capacity crucial. Existing cache replacement policies, from heuristics to learning-based methods, predominantly rely on limited-window statistics such as recency and frequency. We show these signals are not robust for real-world LLM workloads, which exhibit long reuse distances and sparse local recurrence.
  To address these limitations, we propose Relation-Aware Cache (RAC), an online eviction strategy that leverages semantic relations among requests to guide eviction decisions. RAC synthesizes two relation-aware signals: (1) Topical Prevalence, which aggregates access evidence at the topic level to capture long-horizon reuse; and (2) Structural Importance, which leverages local intra-topic dependency structure to discriminate entries by their future reuse value. Extensive evaluations show that RAC maintains high effectiveness across diverse workloads, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by 20%--30% in cache hit ratio.

Abstract: Geo-distribution is essential for modern online applications to ensure service reliability and high availability. However, supporting high-performance serializable transactions in geo-replicated databases remains a significant challenge. This difficulty stems from the extensive over-coordination inherent in distributed atomic commitment, concurrency control, and fault-tolerance replication protocols under high network latency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Minerva, a unified distributed concurrency control designed for highly scalable multi-leader replication. Minerva employs a novel epoch-based asynchronous replication protocol that decouples data propagation from the commitment process, enabling continuous transaction replication. Optimistic concurrency control is used to allow any replicas to execute transactions concurrently and commit without coordination. In stead of aborting transactions when conflicts are detected, Minerva uses deterministic re-execution to resolve conflicts, ensuring serializability without sacrificing performance. To further enhance concurrency, we construct a conflict graph and use a maximum weight independent set algorithm to select the optimal subset of transactions for commitment, minimizing the number of re-executed transactions. Our evaluation demonstrates that Minerva significantly outperforms state-of-the-art replicated databases, achieving over $3\times$ higher throughput in scalability experiments and $2.8\times$ higher throughput during a high network latency simulation with the TPC-C benchmark.

Abstract: This paper argues that reliable end-to-end graph data analytics cannot be achieved by retrieval- or code-generation-centric LLM agents alone. Although large language models (LLMs) provide strong reasoning capabilities, practical graph analytics for non-expert users requires explicit analytical grounding to support intent-to-execution translation, task-aware graph construction, and reliable execution across diverse graph algorithms. We envision Analytics-Augmented Generation (AAG) as a new paradigm that treats analytical computation as a first-class concern and positions LLMs as knowledge-grounded analytical coordinators. By integrating knowledge-driven task planning, algorithm-centric LLM-analytics interaction, and task-aware graph construction, AAG enables end-to-end graph analytics pipelines that translate natural-language user intent into automated execution and interpretable results.

Abstract: Time-series data vary widely across domains, making a universal anomaly detector impractical. Methods that perform well on one dataset often fail to transfer because what counts as an anomaly is context dependent. The key challenge is to design a method that performs well in specific contexts while remaining adaptable across domains with varying data complexities. We present the Robust and Adaptive Model Selection for Time-Series Anomaly Detection RAMSeS framework. RAMSeS comprises two branches: (i) a stacking ensemble optimized with a genetic algorithm to leverage complementary detectors. (ii) An adaptive model-selection branch identifies the best single detector using techniques including Thompson sampling, robustness testing with generative adversarial networks, and Monte Carlo simulations. This dual strategy exploits the collective strength of multiple models and adapts to dataset-specific characteristics. We evaluate RAMSeS and show that it outperforms prior methods on F1.

Abstract: We address the problem of checking query containment, a foundational problem in database research. Although extensively studied in theory research, optimization opportunities arising from query containment are not fully leveraged in commercial database systems, due to the high computational complexity and sometimes even undecidability of the underlying decision problem. In this article, we present the first approach to applying quantum computing to the query containment problem for conjunctive queries under set semantics. We propose a novel formulation as an optimization problem that can be solved on gate-based quantum hardware, and in some cases directly maps to quantum annealers. We formally prove this formulation to be correct and present a prototype implementation which we evaluate using simulator software as well as quantum devices. Our experiments successfully demonstrate that our approach is sound and scales within the current limitations of quantum hardware. In doing so, we show that quantum optimization can effectively address this problem. Thereby, we contribute a new computational perspective on the query containment problem.

Abstract: Generation-based testing techniques have shown their effectiveness in detecting logic bugs of DBMS, which are often caused by improper implementation of query optimizers. Nonetheless, existing generation-based debug tools are limited to single-table queries and there is a substantial research gap regarding multi-table queries with join operators. In this paper, we propose TQS, a novel testing framework targeted at detecting logic bugs derived by queries involving multi-table joins. Given a target DBMS, TQS achieves the goal with two key components: Data-guided Schema and Query Generation (DSG) and Knowledge-guided Query Space Exploration (KQE). DSG addresses the key challenge of multi-table query debugging: how to generate ground-truth (query, result) pairs for verification. It adopts the database normalization technique to generate a testing schema and maintains a bitmap index for result tracking. To improve debug efficiency, DSG also artificially inserts some noises into the generated data. To avoid repetitive query space search, KQE forms the problem as isomorphic graph set discovery and combines the graph embedding and weighted random walk for query generation. We evaluated TQS on four popular DBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB and the gray release of an industry-leading cloud-native database, anonymized as X-DB. Experimental results show that TQS is effective in finding logic bugs of join optimization in database management systems. It successfully detected 115 bugs within 24 hours, including 31 bugs in MySQL, 30 in MariaDB, 31 in TiDB, and 23 in X-DB respectively.

Abstract: As memory increasingly dominates system cost and energy, heterogeneous on-chip memory systems that combine technologies with complementary characteristics are becoming essential. Gain Cell RAM (GCRAM) offers higher density, lower power, and tunable retention, expanding the design space beyond conventional SRAM. To this end, we create an OpenGCRAM compiler supporting both SRAM and GCRAM. It generates macro-level designs and layouts for commercial CMOS processes and characterizes area, delay, and power across user-defined configurations. The tool enables systematic identification of optimal heterogeneous memory configurations for AI tasks under specified performance metrics.

Abstract: In recent engineering applications using deep learning, physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a new development as it can exploit the underlying physics of engineering systems. The novelty of PINN lies in the use of partial differential equations (PDE) for the loss function. Most PINNs are implemented using automatic differentiation (AD) for training the PDE loss functions. A lesser well-known study is the use of finite difference method (FDM) as an alternative. Unlike an AD based PINN, an immediate benefit of using a FDM based PINN is low implementation cost. In this paper, we propose the use of finite difference method for estimating the PDE loss functions in PINN. Our work is inspired by computational analysis in electromagnetic systems that traditionally solve Laplace's equation using successive over-relaxation. In the case of Laplace's equation, our PINN approach can be seen as taking the Laplacian filter response of the neural network output as the loss function. Thus, the implementation of PINN can be very simple. In our experiments, we tested PINN on Laplace's equation and Burger's equation. We showed that using FDM, PINN consistently outperforms non-PINN based deep learning. When comparing to AD based PINNs, we showed that our method is faster to compute as well as on par in terms of error reduction.

Abstract: Finite element simulations are run by package design engineers to model design structures. The process is irreversible meaning every minute structural adjustment requires a fresh input parameter run. In this paper, the problem of modeling changing (small) design structures through varying input parameters is known as inverse prediction. We demonstrate inverse prediction on the electrostatics field of an air-filled capacitor dataset where the structural change is affected by a dynamic parameter to the boundary condition. Using recent AI such as deep generative model, we outperformed best baseline on inverse prediction both visually and in terms of quantitative measure.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of contaminant dispersion, as after a gas leakage incident on a chemical plant, can provide valuable insights for both emergency response and preparedness. Simulation approaches combine incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations with advection-diffusion (AD) processes to model wind and concentration field. However, the computational cost of such high-fidelity simulations increases rapidly for complex geometries like urban environments, making them unfeasible in time-critical or multi-query "what-if" scenarios. Therefore, this study focuses on the application of model order reduction (MOR) techniques enabling fast yet accurate predictions. To this end, a thorough comparison of intrusive and non-intrusive MOR methods is performed for the computationally more demanding parametric INS problem with varying wind velocities. Based on these insights, a non-intrusive reduced-order model (ROM) is constructed accounting for both wind velocity and direction. The study is conducted on a two-dimensional domain derived from real-world building footprints, preserving key features for analyzing the dispersion of, for instance, denser contaminants. The resulting ROM enables faster than real-time predictions of spatio-temporal contaminant dispersion from an instantaneous source under varying wind conditions. This capability allows assessing wind measurement uncertainties through a Monte Carlo analysis. To demonstrate the practical applicability, an interactive dashboard provides intuitive access to simulation results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Convex Agreement (CA) strengthens Byzantine Agreement (BA) by requiring the output agreed upon to lie in the convex hull of the honest parties' inputs. This validity condition is motivated by practical aggregation tasks (e.g., robust learning or sensor fusion) where honest inputs need not coincide but should still constrain the decision. CA inherits BA lower bounds, and optimal synchronous round complexity is easy to obtain (e.g., via Byzantine Broadcast). The main challenge is \emph{communication}: standard approaches for CA have a communication complexity of $Θ(Ln^2)$ for large $L$-bit inputs, leaving a gap in contrast to BA's lower bound of $Ω(Ln)$ bits. While recent work achieves optimal communication complexity of $O(Ln)$ for sufficiently large $L$ [GLW,PODC'25], translating this result to general convexity spaces remained an open problem.
  We investigate this gap for abstract convexity spaces, and we present deterministic synchronous CA protocols with near-optimal communication complexity: when $L = Ω(n \cdot κ)$, where $κ$ is a security parameter, we achieve $O(L\cdot n\log n)$ communication for finite convexity spaces and $O(L\cdot n^{1+o(1)})$ communication for Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our protocols have asymptotically optimal round complexity $O(n)$ and, when a bound on the inputs' lengths $L$ is fixed a priori, we achieve near-optimal resilience $t < n/(ω+\varepsilon)$ for any constant $\varepsilon>0$, where $ω$ is the Helly number of the convexity space. If $L$ is unknown, we still achieve resilience $t<n/(ω+\varepsilon+1)$ for any constant $\varepsilon > 0$. We further note that our protocols can be leveraged to efficiently solve parallel BA.
  Our main technical contribution is the use of extractor graphs to obtain a deterministic assignment of parties to committees, which is resilient against adaptive adversaries.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.
  We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.
  Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\times$ on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96$\times$ without violating SLO.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, but serving them efficiently at scale remains a critical challenge due to their substantial computational and latency demands. While most existing inference frameworks rely on simple scheduling strategies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) at the engine level and Round-Robin (RR) at the scheduler or coordinator level, they often fail to fully utilize system resources and may suffer from issues such as head-of-line blocking and load imbalance. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity. This research proposes a multi-layer scheduling framework tailored for MoE-based LLM serving. It targets scheduling at three levels: request-level, enginelevel, and expert-level. At the request level, we explore algorithms such as Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and priority-aware aging to improve throughput and reduce latency. At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency. Extensive experimental results from more than 100 experiments conducted under diverse workload distributions show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-theart inference framework vLLM, achieving up to 17.8% reduction in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency and 13.3% reduction in Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) latency.

Abstract: Lamport's 1978 paper introduced the happens-before relation and logical clocks, freeing distributed systems from dependence on synchronized physical clocks. This is widely understood as a move away from Newtonian absolute time. We argue that Lamport's formalism retains a deeper and largely unexamined assumption: that causality induces a globally well-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG) over events -- a forward-in-time-only (FITO) structure that functions as an arrow of time embedded at the semantic level. Following Ryle's analysis of category mistakes, we show that this assumption conflates an epistemic construct (the logical ordering of messages) with an ontic claim (that physical causality is globally acyclic and monotonic). We trace this conflation through Shannon's channel model, TLA+, Bell's theorem, and the impossibility results of Fischer-Lynch-Paterson and Brewer's CAP theorem. We then show that special and general relativity permit only local causal structure, and that recent work on indefinite causal order demonstrates that nature admits correlations with no well-defined causal ordering. We propose that mutual information conservation, rather than temporal precedence, provides a more fundamental primitive for distributed consistency.

Abstract: Scaling long-context capabilities is crucial for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, real-world multimodal datasets are extremely heterogeneous. Existing training frameworks predominantly rely on static parallelism strategies, which suffer from severe load imbalance, redundant communication, and suboptimal hardware utilization under data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Parallelism (DHP), an efficient parallelism strategy that adaptively reconfigures communication groups and parallelism degrees during MLLM training. We generalize the non-power-of-two parallelism degrees and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to generate near-optimal parallelism strategies with only millisecond-level overhead per training batch. DHP is able to maintain high hardware efficiency even under extreme data variability. Experimental results demonstrate that DHP significantly outperforms Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, achieving up to 1.36 $\times$ speedup in training throughput while maintaining near-linear scaling efficiency across large-scale NPU clusters.

Abstract: Heterogeneous nodes that combine multi-core CPUs with diverse accelerators are rapidly becoming the norm in both high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructures. Exploiting these platforms, however, requires orchestrating several low-level accelerator APIs such as CUDA, SYCL, and Triton. In some occasions they can be combined with optimized vendor math libraries: e.g., cuBLAS and oneAPI. Each API or library introduces its own abstractions, execution semantics, and synchronization mechanisms. Combining them within a single application is therefore error-prone and labor-intensive. We propose reusing a task-based data-flow methodology together with Task-Aware APIs (TA-libs) to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless integration of multiple accelerator programming models, while still leveraging the best-in-class kernels offered by each API.
  Applications are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of host tasks and device kernels managed by an OpenMP/OmpSs-2 runtime. We introduce Task-Aware SYCL (TASYCL) and leverage Task-Aware CUDA (TACUDA), which elevate individual accelerator invocations to first-class tasks. When multiple native runtimes coexist on the same multi-core CPU, they contend for threads, leading to oversubscription and performance variability. To address this, we unify their thread management under the nOS-V tasking and threading library, to which we contribute a new port of the PoCL (Portable OpenCL) runtime.
  These results demonstrate that task-aware libraries, coupled with the nOS-V library, enable a single application to harness multiple accelerator programming models transparently and efficiently. The proposed methodology is immediately applicable to current heterogeneous nodes and is readily extensible to future systems that integrate even richer combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI accelerators.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a problem of minimizing total energy consumption for secure federated learning (FL) over wireless edge networks. To address the high computational cost and privacy challenges in conventional FL with neural networks (NN) for resource-constrained users, we propose a novel FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. In the considered model, each edge user employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for local training, which replaces complex neural updates with simple hypervector operations, and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model information. We optimize the total energy of computation and communication under both latency and privacy constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization that minimizes the total energy of all users by jointly allocating HDC dimension, transmission time, system bandwidth, transmit power, and CPU frequency. To solve this problem, a sigmoid-variant function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the HDC dimension and the convergence rounds required to reach a target accuracy. Based on this model, we develop two alternating optimization algorithms, where closed-form expressions for time, frequency, bandwidth, and power allocations are derived at each iteration. Since the iterative algorithm requires a feasible initialization, we construct a feasibility problem and obtain feasible initial resource parameters by solving a per round transmission time minimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-HDC-DP framework achieves up to 83.3% total energy reduction compared with the baseline, while attaining about 90% accuracy in approximately 3.5X fewer communication rounds than the NN baseline.

Abstract: As the complexity of the HPC storage stack rapidly grows, domain scientists face increasing challenges in effectively utilizing HPC storage systems to achieve their desired I/O performance. To identify and address I/O issues, scientists largely rely on I/O experts to analyze their I/O traces and provide insights into potential problems. However, with a limited number of I/O experts and the growing demand for data-intensive applications, inaccessibility has become a major bottleneck, hindering scientists from maximizing their productivity. Rapid advances in LLMs make it possible to build an automated tool that brings trustworthy I/O performance diagnosis to domain scientists. However, key challenges remain, such as the inability to handle long context windows, a lack of accurate domain knowledge about HPC I/O, and the generation of hallucinations during complex interactions.In this work, we propose IOAgent as a systematic effort to address these challenges. IOAgent integrates a module-based pre-processor, a RAG-based domain knowledge integrator, and a tree-based merger to accurately diagnose I/O issues from a given Darshan trace file. Similar to an I/O expert, IOAgent provides detailed justifications and references for its diagnoses and offers an interactive interface for scientists to ask targeted follow-up questions. To evaluate IOAgent, we collected a diverse set of labeled job traces and released the first open diagnosis test suite, TraceBench. Using this test suite, we conducted extensive evaluations, demonstrating that IOAgent matches or outperforms state-of-the-art I/O diagnosis tools with accurate and useful diagnosis results. We also show that IOAgent is not tied to specific LLMs, performing similarly well with both proprietary and open-source LLMs. We believe IOAgent has the potential to become a powerful tool for scientists navigating complex HPC I/O subsystems in the future.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and diversity of hardware accelerators in modern computing systems demand flexible, low-overhead program analysis tools. We present PASTA, a low-overhead and modular Program AnalysiS Tool Framework for Accelerators. PASTA abstracts over low-level profiling APIs and diverse deep learning frameworks, offering users a unified interface to capture and analyze runtime events at multiple levels. Its extensible design enables researchers and practitioners to rapidly prototype custom tools with minimal overhead. We demonstrate the utility of PASTA by developing several analysis tools, including a deep learning workload characterization tool and a UVM optimization tool. Through extensive evaluation on mainstream deep learning workloads tested on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs under both single- and multi-GPU scenarios, we demonstrate PASTA's broad applicability. On NVIDIA GPUs, we further show that PASTA provides detailed performance insights with significantly lower overhead, up to 1.3*10^4 faster than conventional analysis tools, thanks to its GPU-accelerated backend. PASTA strikes a practical balance between usability, extensibility, and efficiency, making it well-suited for modern accelerator-based computing environments.

Abstract: Checkpointing is essential for fault tolerance in training large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods, regardless of their I/O strategies, periodically store the entire model and optimizer states, incurring substantial storage overhead and resource contention. Recent studies reveal that updates across LLM layers are highly non-uniform. Across training steps, some layers may undergo more significant changes, while others remain relatively stable or even unchanged. This suggests that selectively checkpointing only layers with significant updates could reduce overhead without harming training. Implementing such selective strategies requires fine-grained control over both weights and optimizer states, which no current tool provides. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{LLMTailor}, a checkpoint-merging framework that filters and assembles layers from different checkpoints to form a composite checkpoint. Our evaluation indicates that LLMTailor can work with different selective checkpointing strategies and effectively reduce checkpoint size (e.g., 4.3 times smaller for Llama3.1-8B) and checkpoint time (e.g., 2.8 times faster for Qwen2.5-7B) while maintaining model quality.
