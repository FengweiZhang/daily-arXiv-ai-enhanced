High-throughput RL post-training therefore relies on dedicated RDMA HPC clusters, an infrastructure cost most organizations cannot absorb. A natural alternative is to aggregate loosely-coupled GPUs over standard Ethernet and WAN links, but this commodity connectivity cannot sustain full-weight broadcasts: synchronizing an 8B model can take over 100~seconds on bandwidth-limited links, while rollout generation typically takes tens of seconds.\n  Toward making RL practical in this regime, we observe that RL fine-tuning yields highly sparse per-step updates, with only around 1\\% of parameter elements changing. Atop this insight, we present SparrowRL, a novel high-performance RL training system that preserves bit-exact updates without dropping or quantizing information, designed for commodity-networked, loosely-coupled GPU resources. SparrowRL represents each step as a sparse delta checkpoint, pipelines delta extraction with multi-stream transmission, overlaps transfer with rollout generation, and coordinates heterogeneous workers with throughput- and bandwidth-aware scheduling plus lease-based fault tolerance. On Qwen3 models from 4B to 14B deployed across up to four geographic regions, SparrowRL reduces per-step transfer payload by 79$\\times$ for Qwen3-8B and improves throughput by 2.4--9.5$\\times$ over full-weight broadcast across WAN, narrowing the throughput gap relative to an ideal RDMA single-datacenter baseline to within 8.91\\%.

Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DPPS's privacy-preserving and demonstrate that PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms."}

The core of LAER-MoE is a novel parallel paradigm, Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP), which fully partitions each expert parameter by the number of devices and restores partial experts at expert granularity through All-to-All communication during training. This allows for flexible re-layout of expert parameters during training to enhance load balancing.

We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router."}

The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data."}

This also limits the deployment of the resource- and investment-intensive security solutions, bringing security issues. Security vulnerabilities arise from the decentralized architecture as well, particularly threats posed by Byzantine nodes. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel framework utilizing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization for tokenizing network resources. RWA tokenization uses blockchain to convert ownership rights of real-world assets into digital tokens that can be programmed, divided, and traded. We then analyze the criteria for identifying suitable assets. Through a case study on dynamic spectrum allocation, we demonstrate the superior performance of this RWA approach. Particularly under conditions of resource scarcity, it can exhibit strong resilience against collusion and default attacks.

With the advent of vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation, k-ANNS has garnered increasing attention. Among existing methods, proximity graphs (PG) based approaches are the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. However, the construction parameters of PGs significantly impact their search performance. Before constructing a PG for a given dataset, it is essential to tune these parameters, which first recommends a set of promising parameters and then estimates the quality of each parameter by building the corresponding PG and then testing its k-ANNS performance. Given that the construction complexity of PGs is superlinear, building and evaluating graph indexes accounts for the primary cost of parameter tuning. Unfortunately, there is currently no method considered and optimized this process.In this paper, we introduce FastPGT, an efficient framework for tuning the PG construction parameters. FastPGT accelerates parameter estimation by building multiple PGs simultaneously, thereby reducing repeated computations. Moreover, we modify the SOTA tuning model to recommend multiple parameters at once, which can be efficiently estimated using our method of building multiple PGs simultaneously.

This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs).

We further conduct rigorous robustness analyses including parameter sensitivity, transaction cost modeling, and regime-conditional performance decomposition, demonstrating the strategy's resilience across bull, bear, and sideways market conditions."}

However, integrated data are not typically graphs but come in different formats, for example, CSV, XML, or a relational database. Façade-X is a recently proposed method for providing direct access to an open-ended set of data formats. The method includes a meta-model that specialises RDF to fit general data structures. This model allows to express SPARQL queries targeting data sources with those structures. Previous work formalised Façade-X and demonstrated how it can theoretically represent any format expressible with a context-free grammar, as well as the relational model. A reference implementation, SPARQL Anything, demonstrates the feasibility of the approach in practice. It is noteworthy that Façade-X utilises a fraction of RDF, and, consequently, not all SPARQL queries yield a solution (i.e. are satisfiable) when evaluated over a Façade-X graph. In this article, we consolidate Façade-X, and we study the satisfiability of basic graph patterns. The theory is accompanied by an algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of basic graph patterns on Façade-X data sources. Furthermore, we provide extensive experiments with a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating practical feasibility, including with real-world queries. Our results pave the way for studying query execution strategies for Façade-X data access with SPARQL and supporting developers to build more efficient data integration systems for knowledge graphs."}

The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\\left(\\left(n\\log\\log n\\log^{(3)} n\\log^{(4)} n\\cdots \\log^{(\\log^* n)} n\\right)\\cdot 2^{\\log^* n}\\right) \\le n(\\log\\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability. This already establishes at least a roughly $\\log n$ complexity gap between randomized protocols in GlobalClock and LocalClock. [2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\\text{poly}(n)$. We observe that it is just as natural to measure expected latency, and prove a $\\log n$-factor complexity gap between the two objectives for memoryless protocols. The In-Expectation complexity is $Θ(n \\log n/\\log\\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $Θ(n\\log^2 n/\\log\\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\\log^2 n/(\\log\\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously."}

However, their effectiveness is often constrained by fidelity: simulators may deviate from the behavior of the final RTL, leading to unreliable performance estimates. Consequently, model calibration, which aligns simulator behavior with the RTL as the ground-truth microarchitecture, becomes essential for achieving accurate performance modeling.\n  To facilitate model calibration accuracy, we propose Microarchitecture Cliffs, a benchmark generation methodology designed to expose mismatches in microarchitectural behavior between the simulator and RTL. After identifying the key architectural components that require calibration, the Cliff methodology enables precise attribution of microarchitectural differences to a single microarchitectural feature through a set of benchmarks. In addition, we develop a set of automated tools to improve the efficiency of the Cliff workflow.\n  We apply the Cliff methodology to calibrate the XiangShan version of gem5 (XS-GEM5) against the XiangShan open-source CPU (XS-RTL). We reduce the performance error of XS-GEM5 from 59.2% to just 1.4% on the Cliff benchmarks. Meanwhile, the calibration guided by Cliffs effectively reduces the relative error of a representative tightly coupled microarchitectural feature by 48.03%. It also substantially lowers the absolute performance error, with reductions of 15.1% and 21.0% on SPECint2017 and SPECfp2017, respectively."}

Such execution also plays a pivotal role in the parallel execution of numerous tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Leveraging the computing resources of multiple devices, the offloading and processing of computationintensive tasks can be carried out more efficiently. However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers."}

The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values. This work is underpinned by a reproducible and extensible framework, TVAM Adaptive Illumination Design(TVAM AID), which makes use of the open-source Core Imaging Library(CIL) that is designed for tomographic imaging with an emphasis on reconstruction. The foundation of TVAM AID which is presented here can hence be easily enhanced by existing functionality in CIL thus lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging use of strategies that already exist for reconstruction optimisation."}

Over the past two decades, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has enabled real-time monitoring of hundreds of thousands of vessels, generating huge amounts of data daily. One major challenge in using AIS data is the presence of large gaps in vessel trajectories, often caused by coverage limitations or intentional transmission interruptions. These gaps can significantly degrade data quality, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete analysis. State-of-the-art imputation approaches have mainly been devised to tackle gaps in vehicle trajectories, even when the underlying road network is not considered. But the motion patterns of sailing vessels differ substantially, e.g., smooth turns, maneuvering near ports, or navigating in adverse weather conditions. In this application paper, we propose HABIT, a lightweight, configurable H3 Aggregation-Based Imputation framework for vessel Trajectories. This data-driven framework provides a valuable means to impute missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing motion patterns from historical AIS data. Our empirical study over AIS data across various timeframes, densities, and vessel types reveals that HABIT produces maritime trajectory imputations performing comparably to baseline methods in terms of accuracy, while performing better in terms of latency while accounting for vessel characteristics and their motion patterns."}

Under review for KDD 2026", "summary": "We present Agent-Diff, a novel benchmarking framework for evaluating agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on real-world tasks that execute code via external APIs. Agentic LLM performance varies due to differences in models, external tool access, prompt structures, and agentic frameworks. Benchmarks must make fundamental trade-offs between a sandboxed approach that controls for variation in software environments and more ecologically valid approaches employing real services. Agent-Diff attempts to capture the desirable features of both of these approaches by including access to the real API interfaces for software services while sandboxing the environment in which calls are made, processed, and evaluated. This approach relies on two key innovations. The first is a novel state-diff contract, which separates process from outcome - rather than fuzzy trace or parameter matching, we define task success as whether the expected change in environment state was achieved. The second is a novel sandbox that provides a standardized scripting layer that all models use to execute code against external APIs (Slack, Box, Linear, Google Calendar). Thus, we can evaluate different agentic LLMs against a standardized set of contracts using a unified sandbox while still evaluating their performance on real-world service interfaces. Using the Agent-Diff framework, we provide benchmarks for nine LLMs across 224 tasks utilizing enterprise software workflows. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of the framework with ablation experiments to assess the contribution of access to API documentation on benchmark performance.

This mismatch between the assumption and real-world spatial-temporal heterogeneity results in suboptimal performance. We present OServe, an LLM serving system with heterogeneous and flexible model deployment that addresses both spatial and temporal heterogeneity.

In order to output walks explicitly, they depart from the classical and well-studied homomorphism semantics. However, it then becomes difficult to present results to users because RPQs may match infinitely many walks. The aforementioned languages use ad-hoc criteria to select a finite subset of those matches. For instance, Cypher uses trail semantics, discarding walks with repeated edges; PGQL and GSQL use shortest walk semantics, retaining only the walks of minimal length among all matched walks; and GQL allows users to choose from several semantics. Even though there is academic research on these semantics, it focuses almost exclusively on evaluation efficiency.\n  In an attempt to better understand, choose and design RPQ semantics, we present a framework to categorize and compare them according to other criteria. We formalize several possible properties, pertaining to the study of RPQ semantics seen as mathematical functions mapping a database and a query to a finite set of walks.

Even with Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology, current single-level memory designs cannot simultaneously satisfy the bandwidth and capacity requirements.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Processing Across Memory (PAM), a KV-centric LLM serving system that coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices within a hierarchical architecture. PAM introduces a novel computing paradigm to balance high memory bandwidth with scalable capacity. First, PAM exploits the inherent context locality in KV access patterns to intelligently distribute KV tokens across the memory hierarchy. Second, to further exploit context locality, it introduces the PAMattention algorithm, enabling fine-grained parallel attention computation across heterogeneous PIM devices. Finally, PAM incorporates an intra-device KV mapping, inter-device KV migration interface, and an inter-device online KV scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance computational workloads.

The sota Text-to-SQL models have achieved impressive accuracy, but their performance critically relies on expert-written evidence, which typically clarifies schema and value linking that existing models struggle to identify. Such limitations stem from the ambiguity of user queries and, more importantly, the complexity of comprehending large-scale and dynamic database values. Consequently, in real-world scenarios where expert assistance is unavailable, existing methods suffer a severe performance collapse, with execution accuracy dropping by over 10%. This underscores their lack of robustness. To address this, we propose DIVER, a robust system that automates evidence reasoning with dynamic interactive value linking. It leverages a compatible toolbox containing diverse tools to probe the database. Then, restricted by a structured workspace (CoTF, Chain of Thoughts and Facts), it reflects based on probe results and selects a new tool for next round of probing. Through this automatically iterative process, DIVER identifies schema and value linking missed by existing methods. Based on these accurate linkings, DIVER is able to infer correct usage of SQL functions and formulas and generate high-quality evidence, achieving robust Text-to-SQL without expert assistance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) The DIVER system significantly enhances the robustness of various Text-to-SQL models, improving performance by up to 10.82% in Execution Accuracy (EX) and 16.09% in Valid Efficiency Score (VES). 2) Our dynamic interactive value linking significantly improves the robustness of existing systems and the accuracy of schema and value linking, especially when confronted with challenges posed by large-scale, dynamic database values."}

We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router."}

Current tools designed for managing contributor retention (e.g., dashboards) fall short by providing retrospective rather than predictive insights to identify potential disengagement early. Without understanding how to anticipate and prevent disengagement, new solutions risk burdening community managers rather than supporting retention management. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we employed a mixed-methods approach for problem identification and solution design to address contributor retention. To identify the challenges hindering retention management in OSS, we conducted semi-structured interviews, a multi-vocal literature review, and community surveys. Then through an iterative build-evaluate cycle, we developed and refined strategies for diagnosing retention risks and informing engagement efforts. We operationalized these strategies into a web-based prototype, incorporating feedback from 100+ OSS practitioners, and conducted an in situ evaluation across two OSS communities. Our study offers (1) empirical insights into the challenges of contributor retention management in OSS, (2) actionable strategies that support OSS community managers' retention efforts, and (3) a practical framework for future research in developing or validating theories about OSS sustainability."}

This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case."}

Despite recent advances, existing quantum software testing approaches rely on simple test inputs and statistical oracles, costly program specifications, and limited validation on real quantum computers. To address these challenges, we propose SB-QOPS, a search-based quantum program testing approach via commuting Pauli strings. SB-QOPS, as a direct extension to a previously proposed QOPS approach, redefines test cases in terms of Pauli strings and introduces a measurement-centric oracle that exploits their commutation properties, enabling effective testing of quantum programs while reducing the need for full program specifications. By systematically exploring the search space through an expectation-value-based fitness function, SB-QOPS improves test budget utilization and increases the likelihood of uncovering subtle faults. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on quantum circuits of up to 29 qubits on real quantum computers and emulators. We assess three search strategies: Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, and the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and evaluate SB-QOPS under both simulated and real noisy conditions. Experiments span three quantum computing platforms: IBM, IQM, and Quantinuum. Results show that SB-QOPS significantly outperforms QOPS, achieving a fault-detection score of 100% for circuits up to 29 qubits, and demonstrating portability across quantum platforms."}

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches often borrow strategies from NLP, relying on chunking-based indexing and similarity-based retrieval. Chunking results in the loss of coherence between code units and overlooks structural relationships, while similarity-driven methods frequently miss functionally relevant dependencies such as helper functions, classes, or global variables. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a repository-level code generation framework that treats code as structured code rather than natural language. Our approach introduces (i) a structure-aware indexing strategy that represents repositories as hierarchical trees of functions, classes, and variables, preserving code structure and dependencies, (ii) a lightweight dependency-aware retriever (DAR) that explicitly identifies and retrieves the true dependencies required by a target function, and (iii) a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines DAR with similarity-based retrieval to provide both essential building blocks and practical usage examples. Extensive experiments on the challenging DevEval and RepoExec benchmarks, both requiring function implementation from real-world repositories with complex large repository context, show that Hydra achieves state-of-the-art performance across open- and closed-source CodeLLMs. Notably, our method establishes a new state of the art in repository-level code generation, surpassing strongest baseline by over 5% in Pass@1 and even enabling smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger ones that rely on existing retrievers."}

Yet, current OSS project recommendation systems primarily emphasize technical attributes, overlooking the collaboration and community aspects that influence contributors' decisions to join and remain in projects. This study investigates how team dynamics within OSS communities influence project selection and how these preferences vary across contributors' motivations. We conducted an online survey with 198 OSS practitioners, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to capture contributors' perceptions of team dynamics. The results reveal that communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity of replies are consistently prioritized across practitioners. However, the relative importance of these team dynamics differs according to contributors' motivations. For instance, practitioners motivated by gaining reputation or networking preferred inclusive project communities that encouraged diverse participation. These findings highlight that understanding how team dynamics align with contributors' motivations provides valuable insights into practitioners' project selection behaviour. Those insights can inform the design of future human-aware project recommendation systems that better account for social collaboration quality and motivational fit."}

However, the probabilistic nature of language models can have inherent hallucinations. Therefore, given a detected inconsistency between the requirement and the web application, it is hard to distinguish whether it stems from the hallucination or a real application bug. Addressing this issue presents two core technical challenges: the implicit oracle inference challenge, where the agent must act as its own oracle to implicitly decide if the application's behavior is correct without guidance, and the probabilistic inference challenge, where an LLM's inconsistent reasoning undermines its trustworthiness as an oracle. Existing LLM-based approaches fail to capture such implicit oracles, either by treating any page navigation that doesn't crash as a success, or by checking each state in isolation, thus missing bugs dependent on context from prior steps.\n  We introduce WebTestPilot, an LLM-based agent designed to address these challenges. WebTestPilot uses (1) a symbolization layer which detects and symbolizes critical GUI elements on the web application into symbols (i.e., variables) and (2) translates natural language specification into a sequence of steps, each of which is equipped with inferred pre- and post-conditions over the symbols as an oracle. This oracle captures data, temporal, and causal dependencies, enabling the validation of implicit requirements. To advance research in this area, we build a benchmark of bug-injected web apps for evaluating NL-to-E2E testing. The results show that WebTestPilot achieves a task completion rate of 99%, with 96% precision and 96% recall in bug detection, outperforming the best baseline (+70 precision, +27 recall).

Recent work has produced accurate models that forecast OSS sustainability, yet these models rarely tell maintainers what to do: their features are often high-level socio-technical signals that are not directly actionable. Decades of empirical software engineering research have accumulated a large but underused body of evidence on concrete practices that improve project health.\n  We close this gap by using LLMs as evidence miners over the SE literature. We design a RAG-pipeline and a two-layer prompting strategy that extract researched actionables (ReACTs): concise, evidence-linked recommendations mapping to specific OSS practices. In the first layer, we systematically explore open LLMs and prompting techniques, selecting the best-performing combination to derive candidate ReACTs from 829 ICSE and FSE papers. In the second layer, we apply follow-up prompting to filter hallucinations, extract impact and evidence, and assess soundness and precision.\n  Our pipeline yields 1,922 ReACTs, of which 1,312 pass strict quality criteria and are organized into practice-oriented categories connectable to project signals from tools like APEX. The result is a reproducible, scalable approach turning scattered research findings into structured, evidence-based actions guiding OSS projects toward sustainability."}

In practical scenarios, users frequently fail to articulate precise directives containing full task details at the onset, and their expressions are typically ambiguous. Consequently, agents are required to converge on the user's true intent via active clarification and interaction during execution. However, existing benchmarks predominantly operate under the idealized assumption that user-issued instructions are complete and unequivocal. This paradigm focuses exclusively on assessing single-turn execution while overlooking the alignment capability of the agent. To address this limitation, we introduce AmbiBench, the first benchmark incorporating a taxonomy of instruction clarity to shift evaluation from unidirectional instruction following to bidirectional intent alignment. Grounded in Cognitive Gap theory, we propose a taxonomy of four clarity levels: Detailed, Standard, Incomplete, and Ambiguous. We construct a rigorous dataset of 240 ecologically valid tasks across 25 applications, subject to strict review protocols. Furthermore, targeting evaluation in dynamic environments, we develop MUSE (Mobile User Satisfaction Evaluator), an automated framework utilizing an MLLM-as-a-judge multi-agent architecture. MUSE performs fine-grained auditing across three dimensions: Outcome Effectiveness, Execution Quality, and Interaction Quality. Empirical results on AmbiBench reveal the performance boundaries of SoTA agents across different clarity levels, quantify the gains derived from active interaction, and validate the strong correlation between MUSE and human judgment. This work redefines evaluation standards, laying the foundation for next-generation agents capable of truly understanding user intent."}

By executing a compiler within a zkVM, our system produces both the compiled output and a cryptographic proof attesting that the compilation was performed on the claimed source code with the claimed compiler. We implement a proof-of-concept implementation using the RISC Zero zkVM and the ChibiCC C compiler, and evaluate it on 200 synthetic programs as well as 31 OpenSSL and 21 libsodium source files.

This study systematically evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for co-evolving grammars and instances of textual DSLs. Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information. Results show strong performance on small-scale cases ($\\geq$94% precision and recall for instances requiring fewer than 20 modified lines), but performance degraded with scale: Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines, while GPT fails on the largest instances. Response time increases substantially with instance size, and grammar evolution complexity and deletion granularity affect performance more than change type. These findings clarify when LLM-based co-evolution is effective and where current limitations remain."}

While effective for mainstream languages, they may underperform on less common or domain-specific languages, prompting companies to develop in-house code generators. While open-source models can be trained for this, only LLMs with tens of billions of parameters match the performance of commercial tools, demanding costly training and deployment. Recent work proposed supporting code generation with smaller models (SLMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and using another SLM to select the most likely correct one. The most recent work in this area is the one by Sun et al. [29] presenting RankEF, a T5 model trained to rank code solutions using both execution-based and non-execution-based information. However, Sun et al. do not assess the T5 ranker's classification accuracy, that is, how often it misjudges correct implementations as incorrect or vice versa, leaving open questions about the reliability of LMs as code correctness judges for other tasks (e.g., automated code review). Moreover, their experiments involve relatively old models, making it unclear the extent to which such a methodology would still help companies in cheaply training their own code generators with performance comparable to those of massive LLMs. We present a study addressing these limitations. We train several state-of-the-art SLMs as code correctness judges and assess their ability to discriminate between correct and wrong implementations. We show that modern SLMs outperform RankEF, even without exploiting execution-based information. When used as code rankers, they achieve higher performance gains than RankEF and perform competitively with LLMs 5-25x larger, at a fraction of the cost."}

Still, it is unclear the extent to which these approaches can recommend quality improvements as a human reviewer. We study the similarities and differences between code reviews performed by humans and those automatically generated by DL models, using ChatGPT-4 as representative of the latter. In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique."}

In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files.\n  Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%. Behaviorally, both LLM-generated and developer-provided context files encourage broader exploration (e.g., more thorough testing and file traversal), and coding agents tend to respect their instructions. Ultimately, we conclude that unnecessary requirements from context files make tasks harder, and human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements."}

Drawing insights from other well-explored application areas like computer vision, we conjecture that the imbalance issue (the number of vulnerable code is extremely small) is at the core of the phenomenon. To validate this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models. The results confirm our conjecture. We also obtain insightful findings on how existing imbalance solutions perform in vulnerability detection. It turns out that these solutions perform differently as well across datasets and evaluation metrics. Specifically: 1) Focal loss is more suitable to improve the precision, 2) mean false error and class-balanced loss encourages the recall, and 3) random over-sampling facilitates the F1-measure. However, none of them excels across all metrics. To delve deeper, we explore external influences on these solutions and offer insights for developing new solutions."}

The results show that while all antipatterns degrade performance as expected, only a subset exhibit a statistically significant relationship between response time and increased power consumption. Specifically, several antipatterns reach CPU saturation, capping power draw regardless of rising response time, whereas others (\\eg Unnecessary Processing, The Ramp) demonstrate energy-performance coupling indicative of inefficiency. Our results show that, while all injected performance antipatterns increase response time as expected, only a subset also behaves as clear energy antipatterns, with several cases reaching a nearly constant CPU power level where additional slowdowns mainly translate into longer execution time rather than higher instantaneous power consumption.

Unit tests generated by tools that employ traditional approaches, such as search-based software testing (SBST), lack readability, naturalness, and practical usability. LLMs have recently provided promising results and become integral to developers' daily practices. Consequently, software repositories now include a mix of human-written tests, LLM-generated tests, and those from tools employing traditional approaches such as SBST. While LLMs' zero-shot capabilities have been widely studied, their few-shot learning potential for unit test generation remains underexplored. Few-shot prompting enables LLMs to learn from examples in the prompt, and automatically retrieving such examples could enhance test suites. This paper empirically investigates how few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources, comprising human, SBST, or LLM, affects the quality of LLM-generated unit tests as program comprehension artifacts and their contribution to improving existing test suites by evaluating not only correctness and coverage but also readability, cognitive complexity, and maintainability in hybrid human-AI codebases. We conducted experiments on HumanEval and ClassEval datasets using GPT-4o, which is integrated into GitHub Copilot and widely used among developers. We also assessed retrieval-based methods for selecting relevant examples. Our results show that LLMs can generate high-quality tests via few-shot prompting, with human-written examples producing the best coverage and correctness. Additionally, selecting examples based on the combined similarity of problem description and code consistently yields the most effective few-shot prompts."}

This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case."}
