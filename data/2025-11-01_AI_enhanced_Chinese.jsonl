On the\ncontrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions,\nhyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution.\nAdditionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection,\nsignificantly affecting their precision.\n  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE\ndistributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced\napproximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial\nparameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and\nreducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE\nmodel. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is\nmore performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More\nprecisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed\ndistributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as\nmean and coefficient of variation.

Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates.

This service can\nreduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and\nenvironmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic\ndecision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)\nfrom ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within\nthe learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing\nn-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive\nspatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the\nnon-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u62fc\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u4e0e\u884c\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u62fc\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u77ed\u89c6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u62fc\u8f66\u4eff\u771f\u5d4c\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Xu\u7b49\u4eba\uff082018\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528n\u6b65\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u53d6\u65f6\u7a7a\u72b6\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u914d\u5957\u7684\u7a7a\u95f2\u8f66\u8f86\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u77ed\u89c6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u6700\u9ad88.4%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8f66\u5185\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc725%\u7684\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u540e\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u534715.1%\uff0c\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1127.3%\uff0c\u8f66\u5185\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1112.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u62fc\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u4e58\u5ba2\u5e26\u6765\u53cc\u91cd\u6536\u76ca\u3002"}}

Most\nrepresentative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,\nSFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task\nsolution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,\nweakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream\nRL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data\nconstruction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to\nquantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical\nstudy finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes\nbetter than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose\nSPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples\nmultimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via\nself-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;\n(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,\ntransferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than\nmemorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep\nreasoning results.

This has led\nto increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose\ninternal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong\nperformance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction\nOptimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure\nof soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft\nprompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial\ndata points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and\n(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency\nwithin each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of\neffectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,\nresulting in more efficient optimization.

In this paper, we demonstrate why\nInfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a\nsimple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI\nestimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling\nconsistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with\nsignificantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using\nproper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the\nlog score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive\nobjectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single\nprincipled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log\nscore achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve\nthe downstream task performance.

Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical\nin safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically\nfail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we\nintroduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for\ninfrequent exploration.

This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models.

This holds promise for both gaining\nscientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable\nmodels for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep\nlearning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming\napproaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by\nscaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic\ninvestigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer\npipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model\nsizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both\nvalidation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We\nfurther identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and\nlearning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of\n$\\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute\nincreases.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u573a\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u5851\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u5851\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f62\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u5f62\u79bb\u6563\u4e3a\u4e09\u89d2\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u8fb9\u957f\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u6f14\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u201c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u201d\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are\nfaced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the\nbug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which\nis not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit\nmessage frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They\nare also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines\ndeleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.\n  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are\nwell-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend\nboth textual data and code in patches and commits.

However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of\nindividual resources independently, without considering their capacity\nconstraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical\nproblem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly\nincorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world\nscenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal\nReinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA.

However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such\nsolutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical\nrequirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to\nthe existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential\nprocess where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive\napproach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.\nThis is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end\nof the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original\ndataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods.

Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering\ngeneralizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified\ngeometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining\nmodel stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across\nmultiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust\nbehavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,\nunderscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior\napproaches.

Existing approaches often\nemploy an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the\ndiffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a\nblack-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the\ndiffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)\nalgorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate\nsamples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG\nperforms weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according\nto the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling\nstrategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to\nour desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution.

In many practical settings, however, user interactions are\nlimited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user.

The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to\nvisual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition\noperators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u201c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u654f\u611f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5\u5f80\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5931\u8d25\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06CLIP\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5757\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u81f3\u5206\u8bcd\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u4f2a\u6700\u4f18\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5374\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u7684SWAP\u3001REPLACE\u548cADD\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4fa7\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4fa7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIP\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for\ntasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several\nheuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior\nsampling is computationally intractable in general.\n  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave\ndistributions $p(x)$.

While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method.

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of\natmosphere-climate dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\uff08FM-Cast\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u73af\u6d41\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u53d8\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u589e\u6e29\uff08SSW\uff09\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u572818\u6b21\u91cd\u5927SSW\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d10\u6b21\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u8fbe20\u5929\uff0c\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8550%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\uff08\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u4e24\u5206\u949f\u5b8c\u621050\u6210\u545830\u5929\u9884\u62a5\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SSW\u53ef\u9884\u62a5\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u589e\u6e29\uff08SSW\uff09\u662f\u6b21\u5b63\u8282\u53ef\u9884\u62a5\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u51ac\u5b63\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u573a\u8bbe\u5b9a\u53ca\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u5de8\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0cSSW\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u62a5\u4ecd\u662f\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SSW\u590d\u6742\u4e09\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6982\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08Flow Matching\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578bFM-Cast\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u73af\u6d41\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u53d8\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57281998\u20132024\u5e74\u95f4\u768418\u6b21\u91cd\u5927SSW\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790SSW\u53ef\u9884\u62a5\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "FM-Cast\u80fd\u63d0\u524d\u6700\u591a20\u5929\u5bf910\u6b21SSW\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u505a\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff1b\u5176\u9884\u62a5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e24\u5206\u949f\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u621050\u6210\u5458\u300130\u5929\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u3002\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0cSSW\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u62a5\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6765\u81ea\u5bf9\u6d41\u5c42\u5f3a\u8feb\u548c\u6e90\u4e8e\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u5f02\u5e38\u6982\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6c14-\u6c14\u5019\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection\nof OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results\nshow Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and\nefficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized\nDeep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21\npercentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that\noptimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,\nmore reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08UAD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6e38\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79cdUAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u7684Deep SVDD\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u53ef\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534721\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8ECG\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u672a\u77e5\u75c5\u7406\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f46\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u73b0\u6709OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6216\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08UAD\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e0a\u6e38\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff08\u6700\u591a512k\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u516d\u79cdUAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ecDeep SVDD\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a9\u7801\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PTB-XL\u548cBUT QDB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9OOD\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7c7b\u522b\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeep SVDD\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684Deep SVDD\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534721\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fDeep SVDD\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8ECG\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently\nenhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR\nparadigm for LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aICPO\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRM\uff09\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u5f3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u56e0\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u7684on-policy rollout\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u800c\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5f3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIn-Context Steered Policy Optimization\uff08ICPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bMixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u63a2\u7d22\uff0cExpert Region Reject Sampling\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684off-policy\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caAnnealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u540e\u671f\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cICPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ICPO\u4e3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684RLVR\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Bernstein\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0eWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6982\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7531Bernstein\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u91cf\u52a0\u6743\u548c\uff0c\u5176\u5747\u503c\u4e0e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u65b9Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001Energy Distance\u548cRMSE\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u903c\u8fd1\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Therefore, the only scalable and viable\nsolution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected\nfrom diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,\nbased on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to\nrun. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to\ntime series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based\napproaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper\nstudies the performance of time series classification methods used as model\nselection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations\nderived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we\npropose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series\nclassification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results\ndemonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly\ndetection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution\ntime. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and\nrepresents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection\nstep in general AutoML pipelines.

Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands\nflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the\nmodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary\nexpert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral\nframework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing\nexpert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both\ntwo-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively\nquery only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active\nlearning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and\nthe core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost\nand predictive performance.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRWM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u60273D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\uff1a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5916\u611f\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u6709\u635f\u6216\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4f7f\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRWM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u81ea\u7136\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u70b9\u4fdd\u6301\u90bb\u8fd1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u771f\u5b9e\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u60273D\u73af\u5883\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGRWM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86rollout\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6269\u5927\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
