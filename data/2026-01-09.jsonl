However, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) finite element methods lack comprehensive rounding error analysis for reduced-precision implementations and use fixed precision assignment strategies that cannot adapt to varying numerical conditioning; (2) spiking neural network accelerators cannot handle non-spike operations and suffer from bit-width escalation as network depth increases; and (3) FPGA tensor accelerators optimize only for dense computations while requiring manual configuration for each sparsity pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{Memory-Guided Unified Hardware Accelerator for Mixed-Precision Scientific Computing}, a novel framework that integrates three enhanced modules with memory-guided adaptation for efficient mixed-workload processing on unified platforms. Our approach employs memory-guided precision selection to overcome fixed precision limitations, integrates experience-driven bit-width management and dynamic parallelism adaptation for enhanced spiking neural network acceleration, and introduces curriculum learning for automatic sparsity pattern discovery. Extensive experiments on FEniCS, COMSOL, ANSYS benchmarks, MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture datasets, and COCO 2017 demonstrate 2.8\\% improvement in numerical accuracy, 47\\% throughput increase, 34\\% energy reduction, and 45-65\\% throughput improvement compared to specialized accelerators.

To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\\times$.

A payment is feasible iff the post-transfer wealth stays in $W_G$. This yields a simple throughput law: if $ζ$ is on-chain settlement bandwidth and $ρ$ the expected fraction of infeasible payments, the sustainable off-chain bandwidth satisfies $S = ζ/ ρ$.\n  Feasibility admits a cut-interval view: for any node set S, the wealth of S must lie in an interval whose width equals the cut capacity $C(δ(S))$. Using this, we show how multi-party channels (coinpools / channel factories) expand $W_G$. Modeling a k-party channel as a k-uniform hyperedge widens every cut in expectation, so $W_G$ grows monotonically with k; for single nodes the expected accessible wealth scales linearly with $k/n$.\n  We also analyze depletion. Under linear, asymmetric fees, cost-minimizing flow within a wealth fiber pushes cycles to the boundary, generically depleting channels except for a residual spanning forest. Three mitigation levers follow: (i) symmetric fees per direction, (ii) convex/tiered fees (effective flow control but at odds with source routing without liquidity disclosure), and (iii) coordinated replenishment (choose an optimal circulation within a fiber).\n  Together, these results explain why two-party meshes struggle to scale and why multi-party primitives are more capital-efficient, yielding higher expected payment bandwidth. They also show how fee design and coordination keep operation inside the feasible region, improving reliability."}

Recently, the statistics and machine learning communities have developed prediction-oriented inference approaches that provide better calibrated uncertainties and adapt to the level of misspecification present. However, these approaches have yet to be demonstrated in the context of complex scientific applications where phenomena of interest are governed by physics-based models. Such settings often involve single realizations of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data and nonlinear, computationally expensive parameter-to-observable maps. This work investigates variational prediction-oriented inference in problems exhibiting these relevant features; namely, we consider a polynomial model and a contaminant transport problem governed by advection-diffusion equations. The prediction-oriented loss is formulated as the log-predictive probability of the calibration data. We study the effects of increasing misspecification and noise, and we assess approximations of the predictive density using Monte Carlo sampling and component-wise kernel density estimation. A novel aspect of this work is applying prediction-oriented inference to the calibration of model-form uncertainty (MFU) representations, which are embedded physics-based modifications to the governing equations that aim to reduce (but rarely eliminate) model misspecification. The computational results demonstrate that prediction-oriented frameworks can provide better uncertainty characterizations in comparison to standard inference while also being amenable to the calibration of MFU representations."}

For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods."}

We formulate the resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and benchmark the proposed approach against classical heuristics, including fixed allocation, random assignment, and the theoretical water-filling algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate that the DQN agent achieves a system throughput of 3.88 Mbps, effectively matching the upper limit of the water fill, while outperforming the random and fixed allocation strategies by approximately 73% and 27%, respectively. Moreover, the agent exhibits emergent fairness, maintaining a Jain's Index of 0.91, and successfully optimizes the trade-off between spectral efficiency and energy consumption. These findings substantiate the efficacy of model-free DRL as a robust and scalable solution for resource management in next-generation communication systems."}

To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks. Moreover, we design a self-adaptive curriculum learning algorithm to progressively move the target model toward hard samples at a controllable pace.

Temporal provenance is a promising direction, attaching timestamps to provenance information, enabling time-focused queries without maintaining complete historical records. However, existing temporal provenance methods primarily focus on system-level debugging, leaving a gap in data management applications. This paper proposes an agenda that uses Temporal Interaction Networks (TINs) to represent temporal provenance efficiently. We demonstrate TINs' applicability across streaming systems, transportation networks, and financial networks. We classify data into discrete and liquid types, define five temporal provenance query types, and propose a state-based indexing approach.

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds.

When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts."}

However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.\n  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.\n  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade."}

However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications."}

However, their performance in credit table understanding (CTU) for financial credit review remains largely unexplored due to the following barriers: low data consistency, high annotation costs stemming from domain-specific knowledge and complex calculations, and evaluation paradigm gaps between benchmark and real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce MMFCTUB (Multi-Modal Financial Credit Table Understanding Benchmark), a practical benchmark, encompassing more than 7,600 high quality CTU samples across 5 table types. MMFCTUB employ a minimally supervised pipeline that adheres to inter-table constraints and maintains data distributions consistency. The benchmark leverages capacity-driven questions and mask-and-recovery strategy to evaluate models' cross-table structure perception, domain knowledge utilization, and numerical calculation capabilities. Utilizing MMFCTUB, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of both proprietary and open-source MLLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in CTU tasks. MMFCTUB serves as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating rigorous evaluation of MLLMs in the domain of CTU."}

In contrast to existing work which has almost exclusively focused on monotone queries, here we explore how to define responsibility measures for unions of conjunctive queries with negated atoms (UCQ${}^\\lnot$). Starting from the question of what constitutes a reasonable notion of explanation or relevance for queries with negated atoms, we propose two approaches, one assigning scores to (positive) database facts and the other also considering negated facts. Our approaches, which are orthogonal to the previously studied score of Reshef et al., can be used to lift previously studied scores for monotone queries, known as drastic Shapley and weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS), to UCQ$^\\lnot$. We investigate the data and combined complexity of the resulting measures, notably showing that the WSMS measures are tractable in data complexity for all UCQ${}^\\lnot$ queries and further establishing tractability in combined complexity for suitable classes of conjunctive queries with negation."}

It executed flawlessly, yet when asked \"Why is completion rate 80%?\", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work."}

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.\n  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.\n  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.\n  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital."}

Many different free-surface models have been proposed, which span modeling complexity from the hydrostatic Saint-Venant equations to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Particularly efficient methods can be derived by depth-averaging, resulting in dimensionally reduced models. Typically, this yields hierarchies of models -- models with a variable system structure depending on the polynomial expansion of the flow variables -- that need to be analyzed and numerically solved.\n  This description, analysis, and simulation are challenging, and existing software solutions only cover a specific subset of models generated by these hierarchies. We propose a new software framework to address this issue. Zoomy allows for an efficient description, symbolic analysis, and numerical solution of depth-averaged hierarchies of free-surface flow models. Zoomy handles a numerical discretization in one- and two-dimensional space on unstructured grids.\n  With this framework, systematic evaluation of hierarchies of depth-averaged free-surface flows becomes feasible. Additionally, our open-source framework increases the accessibility of these depth-averaged systems to application engineers interested in efficient methods for free-surface flows."}

In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude."}

It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs."}

Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter. These results highlight the potential of our method to accelerate NEGF-based nano-device simulations."}

Drawing on traditional ethical theory and practical frameworks for Software Engineering, we analyze five categories of badges and their implications for user autonomy and well-being. Our findings show that, despite small adjustments and superficial disclaimers, many of the original ethical issues remain. We argue for continuous ethical reflection built embedded into software lifecycles to prevent the normalization of risky behaviors through design."}

In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency."}
