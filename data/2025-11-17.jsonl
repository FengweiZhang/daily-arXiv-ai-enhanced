However, evolving requirements, complex inputs, and legacy dependencies hinder the software quality and maintainability. While peer code review can improve software quality, its adoption by research software engineers (RSEs) remains unexplored. Aims: This study explores RSE perspectives on peer code review, focusing on their practices, challenges, and potential improvements. Building on prior work, it aims to uncover how RSEs insights differ from those of other research software developers and identify factors that can enhance code review adoption in this domain. Method: We surveyed RSEs to gather insights into their perspectives on peer code review. The survey design aligned with previous research to enable comparative analysis while including additional questions tailored to RSEs. Results: We received 61 valid responses from the survey. The findings align with prior research while uncovering unique insights about the challenges and practices of RSEs compared to broader developer groups. Conclusions: Peer code review is vital in improving research software's quality, maintainability, and reliability. Despite the unique challenges RSEs face, addressing these through structured processes, improved tools, and targeted training can enhance peer review adoption and effectiveness in research software development."}

Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels. On the full dataset including patches where human raters disagree, we find this approach can still be further improved (Cohen's kappa 0.57, recall 0.93, precision 0.65) and identify possible future directions."}

Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to \"unknown unknowns\".\n  Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.\n  Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.\n  Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.\n  Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking."}

Repairing these bugs requires coordinated edits across multiple, disjoint code regions, posing substantially greater challenges. We present the first systematic study of LLM-driven coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-cli, and Qwen Code) on this task. We evaluate these agents on 372 multi-hunk bugs from the Hunk4J dataset, analyzing 1,488 repair trajectories using fine-grained metrics that capture localization, repair accuracy, regression behavior, and operational dynamics. Results reveal substantial variation: repair accuracy ranges from 25.8% (Qwen Code) to 93.3% (Claude Code) and consistently declines with increasing bug dispersion and complexity. High-performing agents demonstrate superior semantic consistency, achieving positive regression reduction, whereas lower-performing agents often introduce new test failures. Notably, agents do not fail fast; failed repairs consume substantially more resources (39%-343% more tokens) and require longer execution time (43%-427%). Additionally, we developed Maple to provide agents with repository-level context. Empirical results show that Maple improves the repair accuracy of Gemini-cli by 30% through enhanced localization. By analyzing fine-grained metrics and trajectory-level analysis, this study moves beyond accuracy to explain how coding agents localize, reason, and act during multi-hunk repair."}

However, conventional I/O circuitry, including electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection and signaling, introduces significant area overhead. Prior studies have identified this overhead as a major constraint in reducing chiplet size below 100 mm2. In this study, we revisit reliability requirements from the perspective of chiplet interface design. Through parasitic extraction and SPICE simulations, we demonstrate that ESD protection and inter-chiplet signaling can be substantially simplified in future 2.5D/3D packaging technologies. Such simplification, in turn, paves the road for further chiplet miniaturization and improves the composability and reusability of tiny chiplets."}

We propose replacing non-differentiable pipeline components with surrogate models which are inherently differentiable. Using a toy example of aerodynamic shape optimization, we demonstrate an end-to-end differentiable pipeline where a 3D U-Net full-field surrogate replaces both meshing and simulation steps by training it on the mapping between the signed distance field (SDF) of the shape and the fields of interest. This approach enables gradient-based shape optimization without the need for differentiable solvers, which can be useful in situations where adjoint methods are unavailable and/or hard to implement."}

However, UAV-based Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels are highly dependent on height and urban geometry. This paper proposes an ABS height-dependent mmWave channel model and investigates whether urban geometry, beyond the standard built-up parameters, significantly affects LoS probability (PLoS) and Large-Scale Fading (LSF). Using MATLAB ray tracing at 26 GHz, we simulate approximately 10K city realizations for four urban layouts that share identical built-up parameters but differ in their spatial organization. We extract elevation-based PLoS using a sigmoid model and derive height-dependent Path-Loss Exponents (PLEs) and shadow-fading trends using exponential fits. Results show that PLE for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) decreases toward 2.5-3 at high altitudes, Line-of-Sight (LoS) PLE remains near 2, and shadow fading reduces with height. We also find that geometric layout introduces a modest but consistent change in PLE (+/- 0.2), even when built-up parameters are fixed. The proposed unified model aligns well with ray-tracing statistics and offers a practical, height-dependent LSF model suitable for ABS planning in complex urban scenarios."}

To support them, current devices are adopting SoCs (System on Chip) with NPUs (Neural Processing Unit) installed. Although high performance is expected, LLM inference on NPUs is slower than its CPU counterpart. The reason is that NPUs have poor performance on computations other than GEMM, like dequantization. Current works either disaggregate prefill on the NPUs and decoding on the CPUs, or put both on the NPUs but with an accuracy loss. To solve this issue, based on the insight that low-bit can enable target computation encoded within an acceptably sized table, we propose table lookup to subsume hardware operations otherwise unsupported. To realize this, we overcome the conflicting hardware behavior of prefill and decoding to design a unified table layout and tiling through (1) fused two-level table-based dequantization and (2) concurrency-hierarchy-guided tiling. Based on that, we implement the prefill phase by three-stage pipeline and map the table-lookup-based decoding to NPU's vector units. Results show 1.4x and 3.1x speedup for prefill and decoding respectively, and 84% energy savings compared to the baseline NPU methods.

The concept of non-public networks (NPNs) introduced in fifth-generation (5G) will be enhanced by nomadic non-public networks (NNPNs), extending mobility and adaptability beyond fixed locations. These networks help overcome the limitations of traditional static infrastructures, making them applicable to areas such as emergency response, transportation, agriculture, and others. This paper examines the transition from NPNs to NNPNs, highlighting key technical aspects such as network architecture, dynamic resource allocation, and wireless backhauling. Several use cases illustrate how NNPNs improve connectivity in environments where traditional networks are limited. Additionally, the study defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate NNPN applications and establishes a framework for categorizing them based on mobility and operational requirements. Despite their advantages, NNPNs introduce architectural, regulatory, and security challenges such as new approaches for handovers, spectrum policies or cross-border functionality, and trust mechanisms to maintain reliable operations. By identifying use cases, defining evaluation criteria, and addressing technical and regulatory challenges, this paper provides insights into integrating NNPNs into future 6G networks.

However, the risks associated with SCR usage violations have become a growing concern. One particular type of SCR usage violation, known as a logic-level usage violation, is becoming especially harmful. This violation occurs when the SCR adheres to its specified usage rules but fails to align with the specific business logic of the current context, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Detecting such violations necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the contract's business logic, including the ability to extract implicit usage patterns and analyze fine-grained logical behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose SCRUTINEER, the first automated and practical system for detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs. First, we design a composite feature extraction approach that produces three complementary feature representations, supporting subsequent analysis. We then introduce a Large Language Model-powered knowledge construction framework, which leverages comprehension-oriented prompts and domain-specific tools to extract logic-level usage and build the SCR knowledge base. Next, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-driven inspector, which combines a rapid retrieval strategy with both comprehensive and targeted analysis to identify potentially insecure logic-level usages. Finally, we implement a logic-level usage violation analysis engine that integrates a similarity-based checker and a snapshot-based inference conflict checker to enable accurate and robust detection. We evaluate SCRUTINEER from multiple perspectives on 3 ground-truth datasets. The results show that SCRUTINEER achieves a precision of 80.77%, a recall of 82.35%, and an F1-score of 81.55% in detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs."}

Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions."}

Accepted for HPC/Asia 2026", "summary": "Simulation of physical systems is essential in many scientific and engineering domains. Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to deliver high simulation rate or high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads. This paper introduces the novel \\algorithmpropernoun{} algorithm, designed to overcome these limitations. We apply this method and show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second and simulations achieving 84 PFLOP/s. Our implementation can achieve 90\\% of peak performance in both single-node and clustered environments. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale running on a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems."}

However, integrating Agile methods into safety-critical system development in the aerospace industry presents substantial challenges due to its strict compliance requirements, such as those outlined in the DO-178C standard. To achieve this vision, the flexibility of Agile must align with the rigorous certification guidelines, which emphasize documentation, traceability of requirements across different levels and disciplines, and comprehensive verification and validation (V&V) activities. The research work described in this paper proposes a way of using the strengths of the flexible nature of Agile methods to automate and manage change requests throughout the whole software development lifecycle, ensuring robust traceability, regulatory compliance and ultimately facilitating successful certification. This study proposes CertiA360, a tool designed to help teams improve requirement maturity, automate the changes in traceability, and align with the regulatory objectives. The tool was designed and validated in close collaboration with aerospace industry experts, using their feedback to ensure practical application and real-life effectiveness. The feedback collected demonstrated that the automation given by CertiA360 may reduce manual effort and allow response to changing requirements while ensuring compliance with DO-178C. While the tool is not yet qualified under DO-330 (Tool Qualification), findings suggest that when tailored appropriately, Agile methods can not only coexist with the requirements of safety-system development and certification in highly regulated domains like aerospace, but also add efficiency."}

Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems."}
