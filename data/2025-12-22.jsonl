Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.\n  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.\n  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination."}

This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.\n  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.\n  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate.

Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.\n  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads."}

Current collaborative MEC methods primarily support single-server offloading or facilitate interactions among fixed Edge Servers (ESs), limiting flexibility and resource utilization across all ESs to meet the varying computing and networking requirements of AIGC services. We propose AMCoEdge, an adaptive multi-server collaborative MEC approach to enhancing AIGC service efficiency. The AMCoEdge fully utilizes the computing and networking resources across all ESs through adaptive multi-ES selection and dynamic workload allocation, thereby minimizing the offloading make-span of AIGC services. Our design features an online distributed algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, accompanied by theoretical analyses that confirm an approximate linear time complexity. Simulation results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least an 11.04% reduction in task offloading make-span and a 44.86% decrease in failure rate.

From an initial corpus of 412 records, 26 high quality studies were selected using transparent inclusion, exclusion, and quality assessment criteria. The review identifies nine recurring resilience themes encompassing circuit breakers, retries with jitter and budgets, sagas with compensation, idempotency, bulkheads, adaptive backpressure, observability, and chaos validation. As a data oriented contribution, the paper introduces a Recovery Pattern Taxonomy, a Resilience Evaluation Score checklist for standardized benchmarking, and a constraint aware decision matrix mapping latency, consistency, and cost trade offs to appropriate recovery mechanisms.

Adaptive variants update this subset in time, but multiscale systems with widely separated reaction rates remain challenging, as low-probability bottleneck states can carry essential probability flux and the dynamics alternate between fast transients and slowly evolving stiff regimes. We propose a flux-based adaptive FSP method that uses probability flux to drive both state-space pruning and time-step selection. The pruning rule protects low-probability states with large outgoing flux, preserving connectivity in bottleneck systems, while the time-step rule adapts to the instantaneous total flux to handle rate constants spanning several orders of magnitude. Numerical experiments on stiff, oscillatory, and bottleneck reaction networks show that the method maintains accuracy while using substantially smaller state spaces."}

A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment."}

While these stages enhance capability, they introduce significant system bottlenecks. First, multimodal preprocessing-especially video decoding-often dominates Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding. This heterogeneity forces inter-stage blocking and increases token-generation latency. Even when deployed on separate GPUs, these stages underutilize available compute and memory resources, reducing overall utilization and constraining system throughput.\n  To address these challenges, we present FlashCodec and UnifiedServe, two complementary designs that jointly optimize the end-to-end MLLM pipeline. FlashCodec accelerates the multimodal preprocessing stage through collaborative multi-GPU video decoding, reducing decoding latency while preserving high throughput. UnifiedServe optimizes the vision-to-text and inference stages using a logically decoupled their execution to eliminate inter-stage blocking, yet physically sharing GPU resources to maximize GPU system utilization.

Next, we compute a hazard severity index (HSI) by normalizing 24-hour rainfall against local Atlas-14 100-year, 24-hour depths. We then integrate IHL and HSI within a localized threat severity (LTS) matrix using 20 class-specific triggers, requiring lower exceedance in high-risk terrain and higher exceedance in uplands. Applied to two Texas flood events, the LTS exhibits statistically significant spatial association with independent crowdsourced impact proxies, capturing observed disruption hotspots.

In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear affinity gains. Therefore, this work proposes SimBinder-IF, which converts the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator by freezing its structure encoder and training only its decoder to prefer experimentally stronger binders through preference optimization.\n  Results: On the 11-assay AbBiBench benchmark, SimBinder-IF achieves a 55 percent relative improvement in mean Spearman correlation between log-likelihood scores and experimentally measured binding affinity compared to vanilla ESM-IF (from 0.264 to 0.410). In zero-shot generalization across four unseen antigen-antibody complexes, the correlation improves by 156 percent (from 0.115 to 0.294). SimBinder-IF also outperforms baselines in top-10 precision for ten-fold or greater affinity improvements. A case study redesigning antibody F045-092 for A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) shows that SimBinder-IF proposes variants with substantially lower predicted binding free energy changes than ESM-IF (mean Delta Delta G -75.16 vs -46.57). Notably, SimBinder-IF trains only about 18 percent of the parameters of the full ESM-IF model, highlighting its parameter efficiency for high-affinity antibody generation."}

These demands restrict development to a small number of highly specialized engineers. This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.\n  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.\n  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate. Building on this model, the thesis presents Styx, a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides deterministic, multi-partition, serializable transactions with strong fault tolerance guarantees. Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.\n  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads."}

However, little is known about how developers actually use TEEs in practice. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of real-world TEE applications. We collected and analyzed 241 open-source projects from GitHub that utilize the two most widely-adopted TEEs, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone. By combining manual inspection with customized static analysis scripts, we examined their adoption contexts, usage patterns, and development practices across three phases. First, we categorized the projects into 8 application domains and identified trends in TEE adoption over time. We found that the dominant use case is IoT device security (30%), which contrasts sharply with prior academic focus on blockchain and cryptographic systems (7%), while AI model protection (12%) is rapidly emerging as a growing domain. Second, we analyzed how TEEs are integrated into software and observed that 32.4% of the projects reimplement cryptographic functionalities instead of using official SDK APIs, suggesting that current SDKs may have limited usability and portability to meet developers' practical needs. Third, we examined security practices through manual inspection and found that 25.3% (61 of 241) of the projects exhibit insecure coding behaviors when using TEEs, such as hardcoded secrets and missing input validation, which undermine their intended security guarantees. Our findings have important implications for improving the usability of TEE SDKs and supporting developers in trusted software development."}

But these systems struggle to adapt to patients' complex and ever-changing behaviour, and to operate within mobile settings, such as heat and power. To aid this, we present NeuRehab: an end-to-end framework consisting of a training and inference pipeline with AI-based automation, co-designed with neuromorphic computing-based control systems that balance action performance, power consumption, and observed latency. The framework consists of 2 partitions. One is designated for the rehabilitation device based on ultra-low power spiking networks deployed on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. The other resides on stationary hardware that can accommodate computationally intensive hardware for fine-tuning on a per-patient basis. By maintaining a communication channel between both the modules and splitting the algorithm components, the power and latency requirements of the movable system have been optimised, while retaining the learning performance advantages of compute- and power-hungry hardware on the stationary machine. As part of the framework, we propose (a) the split machine learning processes for efficiency in architectural utilisation, and (b) task-specific temporal optimisations to lower edge-inference control latency. This paper evaluates the proposed methods on a reference stepper motor-based shoulder exercise. Overall, these methods offer comparable performance uplifts over the State-of-the-art for neuromorphic deployment, while achieving over 60% savings in both power and latency during inference compared to standard implementations."}

Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.\n  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.\n  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination."}

We introduce a benchmark of 1,000 Python tasks, each paired with an average of 7 developer-specified constraints spanning 13 categories. Constraints are curated through a four-stage human-LLM pipeline to ensure they are atomic, relevant, and objective. We evaluate 14 open- and closed-source models using complementary adherence metrics and propose the C2A Score, a composite measure that jointly captures correctness and constraint compliance. Results reveal a substantial gap between partial and strict satisfaction, while strong models achieve over 90% partial adherence, strict adherence remains between 39-66%. These findings highlight that trustworthy code generation requires not only correctness but also consistent adherence to developer intent."}

However, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new risks to survey integrity, as participants can use generative tools to fabricate or manipulate their responses. This study explores how LLMs are being misused in software engineering surveys and investigates the methodological implications of such behavior for data authenticity, validity, and research integrity. We collected data from two survey deployments conducted in 2025 through the Prolific platform and analyzed the content of participants' answers to identify irregular or falsified responses. A subset of responses suspected of being AI generated was examined through qualitative pattern inspection, narrative characterization, and automated detection using the Scribbr AI Detector. The analysis revealed recurring structural patterns in 49 survey responses indicating synthetic authorship, including repetitive sequencing, uniform phrasing, and superficial personalization. These false narratives mimicked coherent reasoning while concealing fabricated content, undermining construct, internal, and external validity. Our study identifies data authenticity as an emerging dimension of validity in software engineering surveys. We emphasize that reliable evidence now requires combining automated and interpretive verification procedures, transparent reporting, and community standards to detect and prevent AI generated responses, thereby protecting the credibility of surveys in software engineering."}

Prior research has typically examined single issues such as class imbalance or feature irrelevance in isolation, overlooking that real-world data problems frequently co-occur and interact. This study presents, to our knowledge, the first large-scale empirical analysis in SDP that simultaneously examines five co-occurring data quality issues (class imbalance, class overlap, irrelevant features, attribute noise, and outliers) across 374 datasets and five classifiers. We employ Explainable Boosting Machines together with stratified interaction analysis to quantify both direct and conditional effects under default hyperparameter settings, reflecting practical baseline usage.\n  Our results show that co-occurrence is nearly universal: even the least frequent issue (attribute noise) appears alongside others in more than 93% of datasets. Irrelevant features and imbalance are nearly ubiquitous, while class overlap is the most consistently harmful issue. We identify stable tipping points around 0.20 for class overlap, 0.65-0.70 for imbalance, and 0.94 for irrelevance, beyond which most models begin to degrade. We also uncover counterintuitive patterns, such as outliers improving performance when irrelevant features are low, underscoring the importance of context-aware evaluation. Finally, we expose a performance-robustness trade-off: no single learner dominates under all conditions.\n  By jointly analyzing prevalence, co-occurrence, thresholds, and conditional effects, our study directly addresses a persistent gap in SDP research. Hence, moving beyond isolated analyses to provide a holistic, data-aware understanding of how quality issues shape model performance in real-world settings."}

Understanding Smart Contract Semantics and Interactions in the NFT Ecosystem", "comment": null, "summary": "The NFT ecosystem represents an interconnected, decentralized environment that encompasses the creation, distribution, and trading of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), where key actors, such as marketplaces, sellers, and buyers, utilize smart contracts to facilitate secure, transparent, and trustless transactions. Scam tokens are deliberately created to mislead users and facilitate financial exploitation, posing significant risks in the NFT ecosystem. Prior work has explored the NFT ecosystem from various perspectives, including security challenges, actor behaviors, and risks from scams and wash trading, leaving a gap in understanding the semantics and interactions of smart contracts during transactions, and how the risks associated with scam tokens manifest in relation to the semantics and interactions of contracts. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on smart contract semantics and interactions in the NFT ecosystem, using a curated dataset of nearly 100 million transactions across 20 million blocks on Ethereum. We observe a limited semantic diversity among smart contracts in the NFT ecosystem, dominated by proxy, token, and DeFi contracts. Marketplace and proxy registry contracts are the most frequently involved in smart contract interactions during transactions, engaging with a broad spectrum of contracts in the ecosystem. Token contracts exhibit bytecode-level diversity, whereas scam tokens exhibit bytecode convergence. Certain interaction patterns between smart contracts are common to both risky and non-risky transactions, while others are predominantly associated with risky transactions. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to mitigate risks in the blockchain ecosystem, and outline future research directions."}

SGCR features a novel dual-pathway architecture: an explicit path ensures deterministic compliance with predefined rules derived from these specifications, while an implicit path heuristically discovers and verifies issues beyond those rules. Deployed in a live industrial environment at HiThink Research, SGCR's suggestions achieved a 42% developer adoption rate-a 90.9% relative improvement over a baseline LLM (22%).

We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2.
