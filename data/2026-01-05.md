Abstract: Accurate forecasting of financial markets remains a long-standing challenge due to complex temporal and often latent dependencies, non-linear dynamics, and high volatility. Building on our earlier recurrent neural network framework, we present an enhanced StockBot architecture that systematically evaluates modern attention-based, convolutional, and recurrent time-series forecasting models within a unified experimental setting. While attention-based and transformer-inspired models offer increased modeling flexibility, extensive empirical evaluation reveals that a carefully constructed vanilla LSTM consistently achieves superior predictive accuracy and more stable buy/sell decision-making when trained under a common set of default hyperparameters. These results highlight the robustness and data efficiency of recurrent sequence models for financial time-series forecasting, particularly in the absence of extensive hyperparameter tuning or the availability of sufficient data when discretized to single-day intervals. Additionally, these results underscore the importance of architectural inductive bias in data-limited market prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A new computational framework is presented to predict the structural integrity of welds in hydrogen transmission pipelines. The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have been widely applied to solid mechanics problems. However, balancing the governing partial differential equations and boundary conditions remains challenging, particularly in fracture mechanics, where accurate predictions strongly depend on refined sampling near crack tips. To overcome these limitations, a Kolosov-Muskhelishvili informed neural network with Williams enrichment is developed in this study. Benefiting from the holomorphic representation, the governing equations are satisfied by construction, and only boundary points are required for training. Across a series of benchmark problems, the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili informed neural network shows excellent agreement with analytical and finite element method references, achieving average relative errors below 1\% and $R^2$ above 0.99 for both mode I and mode II loadings. Furthermore, three crack propagation criteria (maximum tangential stress, maximum energy release rate, and principle of local symmetry) are integrated into the framework using a transfer learning strategy to predict crack propagation directions. The predicted paths are nearly identical across all criteria, and the transfer learning strategy reduces the required training time by more than 70\%. Overall, the developed framework provides a unified, mesh-free, and physically consistent approach for accurate and efficient crack propagation analysis.

Abstract: This study explores the effects of electric charge on the dynamics of drug transport and absorption in subcutaneous injections of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We develop a novel mathematical and computational model, based on the Nernst-Planck equations and porous media flow theory, to investigate the complex interactions between mAbs and charged species in subcutaneous tissue. The model enables us to study short-term transport dynamics and long-term binding and absorption for two mAbs with different electric properties. We examine the influence of buffer pH, body mass index, injection depth, and formulation concentration on drug distribution and compare our numerical results with experimental data from the literature.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate simulation of blood flow in deformable vessels is critical in cardiovascular research for understanding disease progression and informing clinical decision-making. However, due to the thin-walled nature of arteries, traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approaches based on full-dimensional volume modeling often require extremely fine particle spacing to ensure numerical convergence for the solid mechanics. This, in turn, leads to redundant resolution in the fluid domain to maintain sufficient kernel support near the fluid-solid interface in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient reduced-dimensional shell-based SPH method for modeling thin-walled deformable arteries, and conduct FSI for capturing hemodynamics and arterial wall mechanics. Through a series of validation cases, the proposed shell model demonstrates comparable accuracy in fluid dynamics to the volume model, while achieving faster convergence in solid mechanics and reduced computational cost. We further investigate the influence of wall compliance on flow transitions and key hemodynamic indices, highlighting the necessity of FSI modeling over rigid-wall assumptions. Finally, the method is applied to two patient-specific vascular geometries, i.e. the carotid artery and the aorta, which demonstrates its robustness, efficiency and physiological relevance in realistic cardiovascular simulations.

Abstract: Investment portfolio optimization is a task conducted in all major financial institutions. The Cardinality Constrained Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (CCPO) problem formulation is ubiquitous for portfolio optimization. The challenge of this type of portfolio optimization, a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, arises from the intractability of solutions from exact solvers, where heuristic algorithms are used to find approximate portfolio solutions. CCPO entails many laborious and complex workflows and also requires extensive effort pertaining to heuristic algorithm development, where the combination of pooled heuristic solutions results in improved efficient frontiers. Hence, common approaches are to develop many heuristic algorithms. Agentic frameworks emerge as a promising candidate for many problems within combinatorial optimization, as they have been shown to be equally efficient with regard to automating large workflows and have been shown to be excellent in terms of algorithm development, sometimes surpassing human-level performance. This study implements a novel agentic framework for the CCPO and explores several concrete architectures. In benchmark problems, the implemented agentic framework matches state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, complex workflows and algorithm development efforts are alleviated, while in the worst case, lower but acceptable error is reported.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for high-performance and high-efficiency computing, cloud computing, especially serverless computing, has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years, attracting numerous research attention. Meanwhile, MapReduce, which is a popular big data processing model in the industry, has been widely applied in various fields. Inspired by the serverless framework of Function as a Service and the high concurrency and robustness of MapReduce programming model, this paper focus on combining them to reduce the time span and increase the efficiency when executing the word frequency counting task. In this case, the paper use a MapReduce programming model based on a serverless computing platform to figure out the most optimized number of Map functions and Reduce functions for a particular task. For the same amount of workload, extensive experiments show both execution time reduces and the overall efficiency of the program improves at different rates as the number of map functions and reduce functions increases. This paper suppose the discovery of the most optimized number of map and reduce functions can help cooperations and programmers figure out the most optimized solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deploying LLMs efficiently requires testing hundreds of serving configurations, but evaluating each one on a GPU cluster takes hours and costs thousands of dollars. Discrete-event simulators are faster and cheaper, but they require re-implementing the serving system's control logic -- a burden that compounds as frameworks evolve.
  We present Revati, a time-warp emulator that enables performance modeling by directly executing real serving system code at simulation-like speed. The system intercepts CUDA API calls to virtualize device management, allowing serving frameworks to run without physical GPUs. Instead of executing GPU kernels, it performs time jumps -- fast-forwarding virtual time by predicted kernel durations. We propose a coordination protocol that synchronizes these jumps across distributed processes while preserving causality. On vLLM and SGLang, Revati achieves less than 5% prediction error across multiple models and parallelism configurations, while running 5-17x faster than real GPU execution.

Abstract: Althoughthereislittleempiricalresearchonplatform-specific performance for retail workloads, the digital transformation of the retail industry has accelerated the adoption of cloud-based Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This paper presents a systematic, repeatable comparison of POS workload deployments on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure using real-time API endpoints and open-source benchmarking code. Using free-tier cloud resources, we offer a transparent methodology for POS workload evaluation that small retailers and researchers can use. Our approach measures important performance metrics like response latency, throughput, and scalability while estimating operational costs based on actual resource usage and current public cloud pricing because there is no direct billing under free-tier usage. All the tables and figures in this study are generated directly from code outputs, ensuring that the experimental data and the reported results are consistent. Our analysis shows that GCP achieves 23.0% faster response times at baseline load, while Azure shows 71.9% higher cost efficiency for steady-state operations. We look at the architectural components that lead to these differences and provide a helpful framework for merchants considering cloud point-of-sale implementation. This study establishes a strong, open benchmarking methodology for retail cloud applications and offers the first comprehensive, code-driven comparison of workloads unique to point-of-sale systems across leading cloud platforms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in mobile and edge computing environments is constrained by limited on-device resources, scarce wireless bandwidth, and frequent model evolution. Although edge-cloud collaborative inference with speculative decoding (SD) can reduce end-to-end latency by executing a lightweight draft model at the edge and verifying it with a cloud-side target model, existing frameworks fundamentally rely on tight coupling between the two models. Consequently, repeated model synchronization introduces excessive communication overhead, increasing end-to-end latency, and ultimately limiting the scalability of SD in edge environments. To address these limitations, we propose FlexSpec, a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework tailored for evolving edge-cloud systems. The core design of FlexSpec is a shared-backbone architecture that allows a single and static edge-side draft model to remain compatible with a large family of evolving cloud-side target models. By decoupling edge deployment from cloud-side model updates, FlexSpec eliminates the need for edge-side retraining or repeated model downloads, substantially reducing communication and maintenance costs. Furthermore, to accommodate time-varying wireless conditions and heterogeneous device constraints, we develop a channel-aware adaptive speculation mechanism that dynamically adjusts the speculative draft length based on real-time channel state information and device energy budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexSpec achieves superior performance compared to conventional SD approaches in terms of inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tsunami disasters pose a serious and recurring threat to coastal and island communities. When a large earthquake occurs, people are forced to make evacuation decisions under extreme time pressure, often at the same time as the communication infrastructure is damaged or completely lost. In such circumstances, the familiar channels for sharing information - cellular networks, the internet, and even landlines - can no longer be relied upon. What typically remains are the mobile devices that evacuees carry with them. These devices can form Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), in which messages are forwarded opportunistically whenever people come into contact. To explore this, we evaluate multi-criteria performance characteristics of two DTN routing schemes in a pre-tsunami evacuation scenario for the island of Hachijojima, Japan use case.

Abstract: In this paper, we present \textit{CTMAP}, a large language model (LLM) empowered digital twin framework for connectivity-aware route navigation in millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless networks. Conventional navigation tools optimize only distance, time, or cost, overlooking network connectivity degradation caused by signal blockage in dense urban environments. The proposed framework constructs a digital twin of the physical mmWave network using OpenStreetMap, Blender, and NVIDIA Sionna's ray-tracing engine to simulate realistic received signal strength (RSS) maps. A modified Dijkstra algorithm then generates optimal routes that maximize cumulative RSS, forming the training data for instruction-tuned GPT-4-based reasoning. This integration enables semantic route queries such as ``find the strongest-signal path'' and returns connectivity-optimized paths that are interpretable by users and adaptable to real-time environmental updates. Experimental results demonstrate that CTMAP achieves up to a tenfold improvement in cumulative signal strength compared to shortest-distance baselines, while maintaining high path validity. The synergy of digital twin simulation and LLM reasoning establishes a scalable foundation for intelligent, interpretable, and connectivity-driven navigation, advancing the design of AI-empowered 6G mobility systems.

Abstract: School Campus emergency communication systems are vital for safeguarding student safety during sudden disasters such as typhoons, which frequently cause widespread paralysis of communication infrastructure. Traditional Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) protocols, such as Direct Delivery and First Contact, struggle to maintain reliable connections in such scenarios due to high latency and low delivery rates. This paper proposes the Activity-based First Contact (A-FC) protocol, an innovative routing scheme that leverages real-world social roles to overcome network partitioning by mandatorily uploading messages to highly active "staff nodes". We constructed a real-world evaluation scenario based on the topology of Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School. Simulation results demonstrate that the A-FC protocol significantly outperforms baseline protocols, achieving approximately 68% message delivery probability and reducing average delay to 4311 seconds. With an average hop count of merely 1.68, this protocol establishes a low-cost, highly reliable backup communication model for school campus disaster response.

Abstract: As the transition from 5G to 6G unfolds, a substantial increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is expected, enabling seamless and pervasive connectivity across various applications. Accommodating this surge and meeting the high capacity demands will necessitate the integration of NonTerrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, the extensive coverage area of satellites, relative to terrestrial receivers, will lead to a high density of users attempting to access the channel at the same time, increasing the collision probability. In turn, the deployment of mega constellations make it possible for ground users to be in visibility of more than one satellite at the same time, enabling receiver diversity. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the impact of multi-receivers in scenarios where IoT nodes share the channel following a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. Considering the impairments of satellite channels, we derive a lower bound of system performance, serving as a fast tool for initial evaluation of network behavior. Additionally, we identify the trade-offs inherent to the network design parameters, with a focus on packet loss rate and energy efficiency. Notably, in the visibility of only one extra satellite as receiver yields significant gains in overall system performance.

Abstract: We present MAESTRO, an evaluation suite for the testing, reliability, and observability of LLM-based MAS. MAESTRO standardizes MAS configuration and execution through a unified interface, supports integrating both native and third-party MAS via a repository of examples and lightweight adapters, and exports framework-agnostic execution traces together with system-level signals (e.g., latency, cost, and failures). We instantiate MAESTRO with 12 representative MAS spanning popular agentic frameworks and interaction patterns, and conduct controlled experiments across repeated runs, backend models, and tool configurations. Our case studies show that MAS executions can be structurally stable yet temporally variable, leading to substantial run-to-run variance in performance and reliability. We further find that MAS architecture is the dominant driver of resource profiles, reproducibility, and cost-latency-accuracy trade-off, often outweighing changes in backend models or tool settings. Overall, MAESTRO enables systematic evaluation and provides empirical guidance for designing and optimizing agentic systems.

Abstract: The adoption of Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures requires fronthaul systems capable of carrying large volumes of radio data while meeting stringent delay and jitter requirements. Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) have emerged as a promising fronthaul solution due to their cost efficiency and compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, the traditional registration process for EPON systems halts the ongoing data transmissions during the registration period, thereby violating the enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) delay and jitter requirements. This limitation has been acknowledged by the ITU-T, which recommends the use of a dedicated wavelength channel for registration, leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling framework for a Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexed (TWDM) EPON-based fronthaul that enables periodic registration without wasting an additional wavelength channel. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves up to a 71\% increase in the number of Radio Units (RUs) supported for a given number of wavelength channels, compared to a baseline scheme employing a dedicated registration wavelength.

Abstract: Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) as one of the most promising replacements for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories benefits from higher density and scalability, near-zero leakage power, and non-volatility, but its reliability is threatened by high read disturbance error rate. Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are conventionally suggested to overcome the read disturbance errors in STT-MRAM caches. By employing aggressive ECCs and checking out a cache block on every read access, a high level of cache reliability is achieved. However, to minimize the cache access time in modern processors, all blocks in the target cache set are simultaneously read in parallel for tags comparison operation and only the requested block is sent out, if any, after checking its ECC. These extra cache block reads without checking their ECCs until requesting the blocks by the processor cause the accumulation of read disturbance error, which significantly degrade the cache reliability. In this paper, we first introduce and formulate the read disturbance accumulation phenomenon and reveal that this accumulation due to conventional parallel accesses of cache blocks significantly increases the cache error rate. Then, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, so-called Read Error Accumulation Preventer cache (REAP-cache), to completely eliminate the accumulation of read disturbances without compromising the cache performance. Our evaluations show that the proposed REAP-cache extends the cache Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) by 171x, while increases the cache area by less than 1% and energy consumption by only 2.7%.

Abstract: Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM} (STT-MRAM) is a promising alternative for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories. Besides all its advantages, high error rate in STT-MRAM is a major limiting factor for on-chip cache memories. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis that reveals that the conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) lose their efficiency due to data-dependent error patterns, and then propose an efficient ECC configuration, so-called ROBIN, to improve the correction capability. The evaluations show that the inefficiency of conventional ECC increases the cache error rate by an average of 151.7% while ROBIN reduces this value by more than 28.6x.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) bear great potential for ecology and biodiversity researchers in their ability to support synthesis and integration efforts, meta-analyses, reasoning tasks, and overall machine interoperability of research data. However, this potential is yet to be realized as KGs are notoriously difficult to interact with via their query language SPARQL for many user groups alike. Additionally, a further hindrance for user-KG interaction is the fundamental disconnect between user requirements and requirements KGs have to fulfill regarding machine-interoperability, reasoning tasks, querying, and further technical requirements. Thus, many statements in a KG are of no semantic significance for end users. In this work, we investigate a potential remedy for this challenge: Semantic Units (SUs) are semantically significant, named subgraphs in a KG with the goal to enhance cognitive interoperability for users, and to provide responses to common KG modelling challenges. We model and construct a KG from publication and dataset metadata of the Biodiversity Exploratories (BE), a research platform for functional biodiversity research across research plots in Germany to contribute to biodiversity research from the perspective of computer science. We contribute further by delivering the first implementation of semantic units on a knowledge graph and investigate how SUs impact KG querying. Finally, we present two implementations of tasks that show how large language models (LLMs) can be used to extract structured metadata categories from publication and dataset titles and abstracts, and how embedding models can be used to enrich metadata with latent information, in an effort to support the creation of structured and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) metadata.

Abstract: A significant impediment to high performance in key-value stores is the high cost of thread switching or stalls. While there are many sources for this, a major one is the contention for resources. And this cost increases with load as conflicting operations more frequently try to access data concurrently. Traditional latch-based approaches usually handle these situations by blocking one or more contending threads. Latch-free techniques can avoid this behavior. But the payoff may be limited if latch-free techniques require executing wasted work. In this paper, we show how latch-free techniques exploit delta record updating and can significantly reduce wasted work by using notices, a new latch-free approach. This paper explains how notices work and can solve B-tree index maintenance problems, while avoiding thread switches or stalls. Other opportunities for avoiding thread switches or stalls are also discussed.

Abstract: Real-time log analysis is the cornerstone of observability for modern infrastructure. However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \textbf{KELP} (\textbf{K}elp \textbf{E}volutionary \textbf{L}og \textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput. Our code and dataset can be found at codeberg.org/stonebucklabs/kelp

Abstract: With streaming floating-point numbers being increasingly prevalent, effective and efficient compression of such data is critical. Compression schemes must be able to exploit the similarity, or smoothness, of consecutive numbers and must be able to contend with extreme conditions, such as high-precision values or the absence of smoothness. We present DeXOR, a novel framework that enables decimal XOR procedure to encode decimal-space longest common prefixes and suffixes, achieving optimal prefix reuse and effective redundancy elimination. To ensure accurate and low-cost decompression even with binary-decimal conversion errors, DeXOR incorporates 1) scaled truncation with error-tolerant rounding and 2) different bit management strategies optimized for decimal XOR. Additionally, a robust exception handler enhances stability by managing floating-point exponents, maintaining high compression ratios under extreme conditions. In evaluations across 22 datasets, DeXOR surpasses state-of-the-art schemes, achieving a 15% higher compression ratio and a 20% faster decompression speed while maintaining a competitive compression speed. DeXOR also offers scalability under varying conditions and exhibits robustness in extreme scenarios where other schemes fail.

Abstract: Package dependencies are a critical control point in modern software supply chains. Dependency changes can substantially alter a project's security posture. As AI coding agents increasingly modify software via pull requests, it is unclear whether their dependency decisions introduce distinct security risks.
  We study 117,062 dependency changes from agent- and human-authored pull requests across seven ecosystems. Agents select known-vulnerable versions more often than humans (2.46% vs. 1.64%), and their vulnerable selections are more disruptive to remediate, with 36.8% requiring major-version upgrades compared to 12.9% for humans, despite patched alternatives existing in most cases. At the aggregate level, agent-driven dependency work yields a net vulnerability increase of 98, whereas human-authored work yields a net reduction of 1,316. These findings motivate pull-request-time vulnerability screening and registry-aware guardrails to make agent-driven dependency updates safer.

Abstract: Automated detection of software vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge in software security. Log4j is an industrial-grade Java logging framework listed as one of the top 100 critical open source projects. On Dec. 10, 2021 a severe vulnerability Log4Shell was disclosed before being fully patched with Log4j2 version 2.17.0 on Dec. 18, 2021. However, to this day about 4.1 million, or 33 percent of all Log4j downloads in the last 7 days contain vulnerable packages. Many Log4Shell scanners have since been created to detect if a user's installed Log4j version is vulnerable. Current detection tools primarily focus on identifying the version of Log4j installed, leading to numerous false positives, as they do not check if the software scanned is really vulnerable to malicious actors. This research aims to develop an advanced Log4j scanning tool that can evaluate the real-world exploitability of the software, thereby reducing false positives. Our approach first identifies vulnerabilities and then provides targeted recommendations for mitigating these detected vulnerabilities, along with instant feedback to users. By leveraging GitHub Actions, our tool offers automated and continuous scanning capabilities, ensuring timely identification of vulnerabilities as code changes occur. This integration into existing development workflows enables real-time monitoring and quicker responses to potential threats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating 28 open-source software projects across different releases, achieving an accuracy rate of 91.4% from a sample of 140 scans. Our GitHub action implementation is available at the GitHub marketplace and can be accessed by anyone interested in improving their software security and for future studies. This tool provides a dependable way to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in open-source projects.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for automated software vulnerability detection, a crucial task in securing modern codebases. This paper presents a comparative study on the effectiveness of LLM-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities. The study evaluates three approaches, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and a Dual-Agent LLM framework, against a baseline LLM model. A curated dataset was compiled from Big-Vul and real-world code repositories from GitHub, focusing on five critical Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories: CWE-119, CWE-399, CWE-264, CWE-20, and CWE-200. Our RAG approach, which integrated external domain knowledge from the internet and the MITRE CWE database, achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.86) and F1 score (0.85), highlighting the value of contextual augmentation. Our SFT approach, implemented using parameter-efficient QLoRA adapters, also demonstrated strong performance. Our Dual-Agent system, an architecture in which a secondary agent audits and refines the output of the first, showed promise in improving reasoning transparency and error mitigation, with reduced resource overhead. These results emphasize that incorporating a domain expertise mechanism significantly strengthens the practical applicability of LLMs in real-world vulnerability detection tasks.

Abstract: Repository-level code generation has attracted growing attention in recent years. Unlike function-level code generation, it requires the model to understand the entire repository, reasoning over complex dependencies across functions, classes, and modules. However, existing approaches such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or context-based function selection often fall short: they primarily rely on surface-level similarity and struggle to capture the rich dependencies that govern repository-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce InlineCoder, a novel framework for repository-level code generation. InlineCoder enhances the understanding of repository context by inlining the unfinished function into its call graph, thereby reframing the challenging repository understanding as an easier function-level coding task. Given a function signature, InlineCoder first generates a draft completion, termed an anchor, which approximates downstream dependencies and enables perplexity-based confidence estimation. This anchor drives a bidirectional inlining process: (i) Upstream Inlining, which embeds the anchor into its callers to capture diverse usage scenarios; and (ii) Downstream Retrieval, which integrates the anchor's callees into the prompt to provide precise dependency context. The enriched context, combining draft completion with upstream and downstream perspectives, equips the LLM with a comprehensive repository view.

Abstract: This paper explores the complexities of automatic detection of software similarities, in relation to the unique challenges of digital artifacts, and introduces Project Martial, an open-source software solution for detecting code similarity. This research enumerates some of the existing approaches to counter software plagiarism by examining both the academia and legal landscape, including notable lawsuits and court rulings that have shaped the understanding of software copyright infringements in commercial applications. Furthermore, we categorize the classes of detection challenges based on the available artifacts, and we provide a survey of the previously studied techniques in the literature, including solutions based on fingerprinting, software birthmarks, or code embeddings, and exemplify how a subset of them can be applied in the context of Project Martial.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides abstraction and analytical rigour, but industrial adoption in many domains has been limited by the cost of developing and maintaining models. Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.

Abstract: The primary value of AI agents in software development lies in their ability to extend the developer's capacity for reasoning and action, not to supplant human involvement. To showcase how to use agents working in tandem with developers, we designed a novel approach for carrying out coordinated renaming. Coordinated renaming, where a single rename refactoring triggers refactorings in multiple, related identifiers, is a frequent yet challenging task. Developers must manually propagate these rename refactorings across numerous files and contexts, a process that is both tedious and highly error-prone. State-of-the-art heuristic-based approaches produce an overwhelming number of false positives, while vanilla Large Language Models (LLMs) provide incomplete suggestions due to their limited context and inability to interact with refactoring tools. This leaves developers with incomplete refactorings or burdens them with filtering too many false positives. Coordinated renaming is exactly the kind of repetitive task that agents can significantly reduce the developers' burden while keeping them in the driver's seat.
  We designed, implemented, and evaluated the first multi-agent framework that automates coordinated renaming. It operates on a key insight: a developer's initial refactoring is a clue to infer the scope of related refactorings. Our Scope Inference Agent first transforms this clue into an explicit, natural-language Declared Scope. The Planned Execution Agent then uses this as a strict plan to identify program elements that should undergo refactoring and safely executes the changes by invoking the IDE's own trusted refactoring APIs. Finally, the Replication Agent uses it to guide the project-wide search. We first conducted a formative study on the practice of coordinated renaming in 609K commits in 100 open-source projects and surveyed 205 developers ...

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based applications are increasingly deployed across various domains, including customer service, education, and mobility. However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (SE) requires having a curated collection of models suited to SE tasks. With millions of models hosted on Hugging Face (HF) and new ones continuously being created, it is infeasible to identify SE models without a dedicated catalogue. To address this gap, we present SEMODS: an SE-focused dataset of 3,427 models extracted from HF, combining automated collection with rigorous validation through manual annotation and large language model assistance. Our dataset links models to SE tasks and activities from the software development lifecycle, offering a standardized representation of their evaluation results, and supporting multiple applications such as data analysis, model discovery, benchmarking, and model adaptation.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents transition from code completion tools to full-fledged teammates capable of opening pull requests (PRs) at scale, software maintainers face a new challenge: not just reviewing code, but managing complex interaction loops with non-human contributors. This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins?
  Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting).
  We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance.
  Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.
