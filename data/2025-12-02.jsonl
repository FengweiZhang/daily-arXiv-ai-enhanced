Yet, these domains often demand hefty computational power, translating to substantial energy usage and potentially sidelining less robust computing systems. It's evident that we need an approach that is more encompassing, scalable, and eco-friendly for intelligent algorithm development and implementation. The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions. To level the playing field further, we suggest a statistical 'draw' system, allowing even less powerful nodes a chance to be part of the block creation process."}

The separation for larger $f$ arises from the presence of silenced processes in $\\operatorname{HO}_f$, which may lead to incompatible decisions. The proofs proceed through bidirectional simulations between $\\operatorname{AMP}_f$ and $\\operatorname{HO}_f$ via an intermediate model that captures this notion of silencing.

Co-locating these workloads on shared serving instances can improve resource utilization, but directly applying this approach to Prefill/Decode (P/D) disaggregated systems introduces severe load imbalance, as fluctuating request mixes alter the intrinsic P/D ratio. Existing dynamic adjustment techniques cannot keep up with the bursty traffic patterns of online services.\n  We propose a latency-constraint disaggregated architecture, which separates cluster resources into latency-strict and latency-relaxed pools based on task latency requirements. This design enables flexible placement of offline decode tasks, mitigating P/D imbalance while preserving online performance. To fully exploit this flexibility, we propose (1) a bottleneck-based scheduler guided by a Roofline-based performance model for performance bottleneck based scheduling, and (2) a fast preemption mechanism that strictly enforces Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for online requests.\n  Experiments on real-world traces show that compared to existing offline system approaches, our method improves offline throughput by up to 3x, while maintaining online request SLOs."}

This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well."}

Quantization offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and performance. With ultra-low-bit quantization, there are abundant opportunities for results reuse, and thus it can be boosted with lookup tables (LUTs) based acceleration. However, existing LUT-based methods suffer from computation and hardware overheads for LUT construction, and rely solely on bit-serial computation, which is suboptimal for ternary-weight networks. We propose Platinum, a lightweight ASIC accelerator for integer weight mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) using LUTs. Platinum reduces LUT construction overhead via offline-generated construction paths and supports both general bit-serial and optimized ternary-weight execution through adaptive path switching. On BitNet b1.58-3B, Platinum achieves up to 73.6x, 4.09x, and 2.15x speedups over SpikingEyeriss, Prosperity, and 16-thread T-MAC (CPU), respectively, along with energy reductions of 32.4x, 3.23x, and 20.9x, all within a 0.96mm2 chip area.

The textual semantics of data products are vital for pricing and contain significant value that remains largely underexplored. Therefore, to investigate how textual features influence data product pricing, we employ five prevalent text representation techniques to encode the descriptive text of data products. And then, we employ six machine learning methods to predict data product prices, including linear regression, neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and XGBoost. Our empirical design consists of two tasks: a regression task that predicts the continuous price of data products, and a classification task that discretizes price into ordered categories. Furthermore, we conduct feature importance analysis by the mRMR feature selection method and SHAP-based interpretability techniques. Based on empirical data from the AWA Data Exchange, we find that for predicting continuous prices, Word2Vec text representations capturing semantic similarity yield superior performance. In contrast, for price-tier classification tasks, simpler representations that do not rely on semantic similarity, such as Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, perform better. SHAP analysis reveals that semantic features related to healthcare and demographics tend to increase prices, whereas those associated with weather and environmental topics are linked to lower prices. This analytical framework significantly enhances the interpretability of pricing models."}

Instead, its construction process transfers trust from widely-used, third-party services onto ZipperChains's correctness guarantees. ZipperChain blocks are built by a pipeline of specialized services deployed on a small number of nodes connected by a fast data center network.

However, large convolutional layers must be partitioned across multiple crossbars, generating numerous partial sums (psums) that require additional buffer, transfer, and accumulation, thus introducing significant system-level overhead. Inspired by dendritic computing principles from neuroscience, we propose crossbar-aware dendritic convolution (CADC), a novel approach that dramatically increases sparsity in psums by embedding a nonlinear dendritic function (zeroing negative values) directly within crossbar computations. Experimental results demonstrate that CADC significantly reduces psums, eliminating 80% in LeNet-5 on MNIST, 54% in ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, 66% in VGG-16 on CIFAR-100, and up to 88% in spiking neural networks (SNN) on the DVS Gesture dataset. The induced sparsity from CADC provides two key benefits: (1) enabling zero-compression and zero-skipping, thus reducing buffer and transfer overhead by 29.3% and accumulation overhead by 47.9%; (2) minimizing ADC quantization noise accumulation, resulting in small accuracy degradation - only 0.01% for LeNet-5, 0.1% for ResNet-18, 0.5% for VGG-16, and 0.9% for SNN. Compared to vanilla convolution (vConv), CADC exhibits accuracy changes ranging from +0.11% to +0.19% for LeNet-5, -0.04% to -0.27% for ResNet-18, +0.99% to +1.60% for VGG-16, and -0.57% to +1.32% for SNN, across crossbar sizes from 64x64 to 256x256. Ultimately, a SRAM-based IMC implementation of CADC achieves 2.15 TOPS and 40.8 TOPS/W for ResNet-18 (4/2/4b), realizing an 11x-18x speedup and 1.9x-22.9x improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing IMC accelerators."}

Their exact computation, however, is intractable because it requires aggregating marginal contributions over exponentially many permutations or subsets. While sampling-based estimators have been studied in cooperative game theory, their direct use for relational query answering remains underexplored and often ignores the structure of schemas and joins.\n  We study tuple-level attribution for relational queries through sampling and introduce Relation-Stratified Sampling (RSS). Instead of stratifying coalitions only by size, RSS partitions the sample space by a relation-wise count vector that records how many tuples are drawn from each relation. This join-aware stratification concentrates samples on structurally valid and informative coalitions and avoids strata that cannot satisfy query conditions. We further develop an adaptive variant, ARSS, that reallocates budget across strata using variance estimates obtained during sampling, improving estimator efficiency without increasing the total number of samples. We analyze these estimators, describe a practical implementation that reuses compiled views to reduce per-sample query cost, and evaluate them on TPCH workloads.\n  Across diverse queries with multi-relation joins and aggregates, RSS and ARSS consistently outperform classical Monte Carlo (MCS) and size-based Stratified Sampling (SS), yielding lower error and variance with fewer samples. An ablation shows that relation-aware stratification and adaptive allocation contribute complementary gains, making ARSS a simple, effective, and anytime estimator for database-centric Shapley attribution."}

Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.\n  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.\n  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.\n  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages.

Recent studies indicate that distributed databases exhibit significantly higher latency than single-node databases, primarily due to consensus protocols maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes. We argue that synchronization cost constitutes the primary bottleneck for distributed databases, which is particularly pronounced in wide-area networks (WAN). Fortunately, we identify opportunities to optimize synchronization costs in real production environments: (1) network clustering phenomena, (2) triangle inequality violations in transmission, and (3) redundant data transfers. Based on these observations, we propose GeoCoCo, a synchronization acceleration framework for cross-region distributed databases. First, GeoCoCo presents a group rescheduling strategy that adapts to real-time network conditions to maximize WAN transmission efficiency. Second, GeoCoCo introduces a task-preserving data filtering method that reduces data volume transmitted over the WAN. Finally, GeoCoCo develops a consistency-guaranteed transmission framework integrating grouping and pruning. Extensive evaluations in both trace-driven simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GeoCoCo reduces synchronization cost-primarily by lowering WAN bandwidth usage-by up to 40.3%, and increases system throughput by up to 14.1% in GeoGauss."}

This approach is theoretically guaranteed to converge, provided each of the individual subproblems is solved successfully. However, strong non-linearities of the energy functional may lead to failure of iterative convergence within one or both subproblems. In this paper, we propose an exact line search algorithm based on bisection, which (under certain conditions) guarantees global convergence of Newton's method for each subproblem and consequently the successful determination of critical points of the energy through the alternate minimization scheme. Through several benchmark tests computed with various strain energy decompositions and two strategies for the enforcement of the irreversibility constraint in two and three dimensions, we demonstrate the robustness of the approach and assess its efficiency in comparison with other commonly used line search algorithms."}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "The proliferation of mission-critical latency-sensitive services has intensified the demand for next-generation cloud-integrated networks to guarantee both reliable and resilient service delivery. While reliability imposes timely-throughput requirements, i.e., percentage of packets to be delivered within a prescribed per-packet deadline, resilience relates to the network's ability to swiftly recover timely-throughput performance following an outage event, such as node or link failures. While recent studies have increasingly focused on designing reliable network control policies, a comprehensive solution that combines reliable and resilient network control has yet to be fully explored. This paper formulates the multi-commodity least-cost resilient and reliable network control (MC-LC-ResRNC) problem as a stochastic control problem with long and short-term timely throughput constraints. We then present a solution through the Multi-Commodity Resilient and Reliable Cloud Network Control (MC-ResRCNC) algorithm and show through numerical experiments that it jointly ensures reliability under normal conditions and resilience upon network failure."}

Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.\n  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels."}

With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), recent studies have explored zero-shot and few-shot prompting to improve entity matching accuracy. However, most existing approaches rely on single-step prompting and offer limited investigation into structured reasoning strategies. In this work, we investigate how to enhance LLM-based entity matching by decomposing the matching process into multiple explicit reasoning stages. We propose a three-step framework that first identifies matched and unmatched tokens between two records, then determines the attributes most influential to the matching decision, and finally predicts whether the records refer to the same real-world entity. In addition, we explore a debate-based strategy that contrasts supporting and opposing arguments to improve decision robustness. We evaluate our approaches against multiple existing baselines on several real-world entity matching benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that structured multi-step reasoning can improve matching performance in several cases, while also highlighting remaining challenges and opportunities for further refinement of reasoning-guided LLM approaches."}

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation."}

In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows dynamics and live streaming contains frequent on-off mode switching in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming's client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability and profitability of AutoRec."}

The present paper studies the Simultaneous Agreement problem for the crash failures model, and a number of limited information exchanges from the literature. In particular, the paper considers information exchanges from a FloodSet protocol (Lynch, Distributed Algorithms 1996), a variant of this in which agents also count the number of failures (Castañeda et al, NETYS 2017), and a variant in which agents associate each agent with a value (Raynal, PRDC 2002).

Besides its lower leakage power, higher density, immunity to radiation-induced particles, and non-volatility, an unintentional bit flip during read operation, referred to as read disturbance error, is a severe reliability challenge in STT-MRAM caches. One major source of read disturbance error in STT-MRAM caches is simultaneous accesses to all tags for parallel comparison operation in a cache set, which has not been addressed in previous work. This paper first demonstrates that high read accesses to tag array extremely increase the read disturbance rate and then proposes a low-cost scheme, so-called Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison (3RSeT), to reduce the error rate by eliminating a significant portion of tag reads. 3RSeT proactively disables the tags that have no chance for hit, using low significant bits of the tags on each access request. Our evaluations using gem5 full-system cycle-accurate simulator show that 3RSeT reduces the read disturbance rate in the tag array by 71.8%, which results in 3.6x improvement in Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). In addition, the energy consumption is reduced by 62.1% without compromising performance and with less than 0.4% area overhead."}

Serial Safety Net (SSN) offers a lightweight commit-time test but is conservative and effectively anchored on commit time as the sole point. We present ESSN, a principled generalization of SSN that relaxes the exclusion condition to allow more transactions to commit safely, and we prove that this preserves multiversion serializability (MVSR) and that it strictly subsumes SSN. ESSN states an MVSG (Multiversion Serialization Graph)-based criterion and introduces a known total order over transactions (KTO; e.g., begin-ordered or commit-ordered) for reasoning about the graph's serializability. With a single commit-time check under invariant-based semantics, ESSN's exclusion condition preserves monotonicity along per-item version chains, and eliminates chain traversal. The protocol is Direct Serialization Graph (DSG)-based with commit-time work linear in the number of reads and writes, matching SSN's per-version footprint. We also make mixed workloads explicit by defining a Long transaction via strict interval containment of Short transactions, and we evaluate ESSN on reproducible workloads. Under a commit-ordered KTO, using begin-snapshot reads reduces the long-transaction abort rate by up to approximately 0.25 absolute (about 50% relative) compared with SSN."}

However, many domain scientists lack the programming expertise required to develop custom data analysis workflows, creating barriers to timely and effective insight. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of LLM-driven automation in scientific workflows and introduces actionable techniques and a reusable benchmark for building more inclusive, accessible, and trustworthy AI-assisted research tools."}

In contrast, complex requests often require the superior capability of cloud models, incurring higher latency and cost. To navigate this quality-cost trade-off under dynamic network conditions, we propose a cloud-edge synergy for NetGPT that integrates network-aware routing with on-edge self-improvement. Specifically, our framework routes structured tool-calling requests to cloud or edge agents via a novel scoring policy. We prove that, under mild regularity assumptions, the optimal routing rule admits a unique fallback threshold with monotone dependence on bandwidth and round-trip time (RTT). Concurrently, based on the dataset collected from requests routed to the cloud and corresponding responses, we instantiate a schema-preserving reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the capability of the edge agent. We analyze a supervised finetuning (SFT)-anchored composite objective that combines a reverse-KL trust-region step with a forward-KL realignment toward the SFT prior, explaining stability and constraining policy drift. Both the network-aware routing policy and the edge agent are updated coherently. Experiments across controlled network states and pricing schedules demonstrate smooth quality-cost frontiers, consistent gains of dynamic fallback thresholds over fixed policies, and sustained reductions in offloading while maintaining task success and schema-correct outputs."}

In recent years, many proprietary and open cache-coherent interconnect standards have emerged, among which compute express link (CXL) prevails in the open-standard domain after acquiring several competing solutions. Although CXL-based coherent heterogeneous computing holds the potential to fundamentally transform the collaborative computing mode of CPUs and XPUs, research in this direction remains hampered by the scarcity of available CXL-supported platforms, immature software/hardware ecosystems, and unclear application prospects. This paper presents Cohet, the first CXL-driven coherent heterogeneous computing framework. Cohet decouples the compute and memory resources to form unbiased CPU and XPU pools which share a single unified and coherent memory pool. It exposes a standard malloc/mmap interface to both CPU and XPU compute threads, leaving the OS dealing with smart memory allocation and management of heterogeneous resources. To facilitate Cohet research, we also present a full-system cycle-level simulator named SimCXL, which is capable of modeling all CXL sub-protocols and device types. SimCXL has been rigorously calibrated against a real CXL testbed with various CXL memory and accelerators, showing an average simulation error of 3%. Our evaluation reveals that CXL.cache reduces latency by 68% and increases bandwidth by 14.4x compared to DMA transfers at cacheline granularity. Building upon these insights, we demonstrate the benefits of Cohet with two killer apps, which are remote atomic operation (RAO) and remote procedure call (RPC). Compared to PCIe-NIC design, CXL-NIC achieves a 5.5 to 40.2x speedup for RAO offloading and an average speedup of 1.86x for RPC (de)serialization offloading."}

RIPE Atlas boasts over 12.9K vantage points in 178 countries worldwide and serves as a vital tool for analyzing anycast deployment, network latency, and topology, to name a few. Despite generating over a terabyte of measurement results per day, there is limited understanding of the underlying processes. This paper delves into one day in the life of RIPE Atlas, encompassing 50.9K unique measurements and over 1.3 billion results. While most daily measurements are user-defined, it is built-ins and anchor meshes that account for 89% of produced results. We extensively examine how different probes and measurements contribute to the daily operations of RIPE Atlas and consider any bias they may introduce. Furthermore, we demonstrate how existing measurements can be leveraged to investigate censorship, traceroute symmetry, and the usage of reserved address blocks, among others. Finally, we curate a set of recommendations for researchers using the RIPE Atlas platform to foster transparency, reproducibility, and ethics."}

Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.\n  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.\n  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.\n  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.\n  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications."}

Nevertheless, its very high error rate has thwarted its general adoption. Moreover, recent undervolting accelerators rely on 8-bit arithmetic and cannot compete with state-of-the-art low-precision (<8b) architectures. To overcome these issues, we propose a new technique called Guarded Aggressive underVolting (GAV), which combines the ideas of undervolting and bit-serial computation to create a flexible approximation method based on aggressively lowering the supply voltage on a select number of least significant bit combinations. Based on this idea, we implement GAVINA (GAV mIxed-precisioN Accelerator), a novel architecture that supports arbitrary mixed precision and flexible undervolting, with an energy efficiency of up to 89 TOP/sW in its most aggressive configuration. By developing an error model of GAVINA, we show that GAV can achieve an energy efficiency boost of 20% via undervolting, with negligible accuracy degradation on ResNet-18."}

Local caching of responses offers a practical solution to reduce the cost and latency of LLM queries. In research contexts, caching also enhances reproducibility and provides flexibility for experimentation. However, naive reuse of cached responses compromises statistical independence, a critical property for probabilistic workflows. In applications of LLM for code, it underpins performance metrics such as Pass@k and uncertainty estimation, as well as algorithms like program repair loops and retries. Existing LLM caching systems lack ways to enforce statistical independence constraints. To address this, we introduce Mnimi, a cache design pattern that supports modular LLM workflows while ensuring statistical integrity at the component level. Its core innovation lies in encapsulating statistical constraints within the type of LLM references, allowing users to manage and transform these types according to the scope and requirements of their algorithm. We implemented this design pattern in Python using a combination of decorators and iterators over infinite sequences. A case study on SpecFix, an recent automated program specification repair system, highlights how Mnimi improves reproducibility, ease of debugging, time and cost efficiency while preserving statistical correctness."}

However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving.

They help guide responsible vulnerability reporting and build trust among users and contributors. Despite their growing use, it is still unclear how these policies influence the structure and evolution of software dependencies. Software dependencies are external packages or libraries that a project relies on, and their interconnected nature affects both functionality and security. This study explores the relationship between security policies and dependency management in PyPI projects. We analyzed projects with and without a SECURITY.md file by examining their dependency trees and tracking how dependencies change over time. The analysis shows that projects with a security policy tend to rely on a broader set of direct dependencies, while overall depth and transitive dependencies remain similar. Historically, projects created after the introduction of SECURITY.md, particularly later adopters, show more frequent dependency updates. These results suggest that security policies are linked to more modular and feature-rich projects, and highlight the role of SECURITY.md in promoting proactive dependency management and reducing risks in the software supply chain."}

This paper investigates multi-armed bandit (MAB) strategies as a data-driven approach for decentralized, online channel access optimization in Wi-Fi, targeting dynamic channel access settings: primary channel, channel width, and contention window (CW) adjustment. Key design aspects are examined, including the adoption of joint versus factorial action spaces, the inclusion of contextual information, and the nature of the action-selection strategy (optimism-driven, unimodal, or randomized). State-of-the-art algorithms and a proposed lightweight contextual approach, E-RLB, are evaluated through simulations. Results show that contextual and optimism-driven strategies consistently achieve the highest performance and fastest adaptation under recurrent conditions. Unimodal structures require careful graph construction to ensure that the unimodality assumption holds. Randomized exploration, adopted in the proposed E-RLB, can induce disruptive parameter reallocations, especially in multi-player settings. Decomposing the action space across several specialized agents accelerates convergence but increases sensitivity to randomized exploration and demands coordination under shared rewards to avoid correlated learning. Finally, despite its inherent inefficiencies from epsilon-greedy exploration, E-RLB demonstrates effective adaptation and learning, highlighting its potential as a viable low-complexity solution for realistic dynamic deployments."}

Conflicting subDAGs are resolved by a closest common ancestor (CCA)-local, window-filtered fork choice that compares the weight of each subDAG -- the number of recent short references -- and prefers the heavier one. Combined with a structural invariant we call Tip-Boundedness (TB), this yields a bounded-width frontier and allows honest work to aggregate quickly.\n  We formalize an idealized protocol (Areon-Ideal) that abstracts away network delay and reference bounds, and a practical protocol (Areon-Base) that adds VRF-based eligibility, bounded short and long references, and application-level validity and conflict checks at the block level. On top of DAG analogues of the classical common-prefix, chain-growth, and chain-quality properties, we prove a backbone-style $(k,\\varepsilon)$-finality theorem that calibrates confirmation depth as a function of the window length and target tail probability.

Deterministic communication across heterogeneous 5G-TSN systems requires joint scheduling between both domains. A key prerequisite for time-aware end-to-end scheduling is determining the forwarding delay for each TSN Traffic Class at every bridge, referred to as Bridge Delay (BD). Hence, to integrate 5G as a transparent TSN bridge, the 5G BD must be determined and guaranteed. Unlike wired bridges, the 5G BD relies on wireless resource management characteristics, such as the Time Division Duplex pattern and radio resource allocation procedure. In particular, traditional Uplink (UL) schedulers are optimized for throughput but often fail to meet the deadline requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a heterogeneous radio resource scheduler that integrates static and dynamic scheduling. The algorithm pre-allocates resources for time-sensitive periodic streams based on the reported BDs, ensuring alignment with the TSN mechanisms Time-Aware Shaper and Per-Stream Filtering and Policing. Meanwhile, remaining resources are dynamically allocated to non-deterministic flows using established strategies such as Proportional Fair, Max C/I, or a Quality of Service-aware priority-based scheduler. The scheduler's performance is evaluated through OMNeT++ simulations. The results demonstrate support for diverse TSN flows while ensuring deadline-aware scheduling of time-sensitive UL traffic in mobility scenarios. Periodic time-sensitive flows are end-to-end scheduled across domains, improving the resource efficiency by 28% compared to the Configured Grant baseline. While reliability is preserved, non-deterministic rate-sensitive flows benefit from the improved resource utilization, resulting in higher throughput"}

By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples. The overlap of communication and computation in this way significantly reduces the total training time. Given that training efficiency is affected by position of cutting layer and heterogeneity of the UEs, we formulate a joint optimization problem of task split and resource allocation, and design a solution based on alternating optimization.

We evaluate NOMAD through a mixed design: a large case study (Northwind) for in-depth probing and error analysis, and human-authored UML exercises for breadth and realism. NOMAD outperforms all selected baselines, while revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained attribute extraction. Building on these observations, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of errors in LLM-generated UML diagrams, categorising structural, relationship, and semantic/logical.

Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation. Our evaluation on Defects4J v2.0.0 demonstrates that MBFL-DKMR effectively mitigates the noise and outperforms the state-of-the-art MBFL techniques. Specifically, MBFL-DKMR achieves 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001\\% of total time). This work highlights the potential of signal processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MBFL by refining the kill matrix."}

Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios."}

This paper focuses on issues such as increasing client density and traffic congestion by proposing a digital twin for computer networks. Our Digital Twin, named Access Point Digital Twin (APDT) is used for tracking user behavior and changing bandwidth demands, directly impacting network performance and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like latency, jitter, etc. APDT captures the real-time state of networks with data from access points (APs), enabling simulation-based analyses and predictive modelling. APDT facilitates the simulation of various what-if scenarios thereby providing a better understanding of various aspects of the network characteristics. We tested APDT on our University network. APDT uses data collected from three access points via the Ruckus SmartZone API and incorporates NS-3 based simulations. The simulation replicates a real-time snapshot from a Ruckus access point and models metrics such as latency and inter-packet transfer time. Additionally, a forecasting model predicts traffic congestion and suggests proactive client offloading, enhancing network management and performance optimization. Preliminary results indicate that APDT can successfully predict short-term traffic surges, leading to improved QoS and reduced traffic congestion."}

The study focuses on the CASCADE protocol and the design of a software prototype intended for research and educational purposes. A parallel error-correction algorithm based on the actor model was implemented, improving the efficiency of key reconciliation and reducing the amount of exchanged data. Evaluation of the prototype revealed limitations, including the computational cost of message passing, complexity of error handling, and code redundancy due to iterative development. Experimental results confirmed the correct implementation of the core CASCADE algorithms and informed the design of future improvements. Proposed enhancements include redesigning the system architecture, developing interfaces for exporting intermediate data, defining the communication channel as a separate component, and expanding tools for systematic verification and comparative analysis of blind key-reconciliation methods."}

A Longitudinal Study of LLM Evolution in Software Engineering Project-Based Learning", "comment": "Accepted by ICSE-SEET (ACM/IEEE 48th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training)", "summary": "As LLMs reshape software development, integrating LLM-augmented practices into SE education has become imperative. While existing studies explore LLMs' educational use in introductory programming or isolated SE tasks, their impact in more open-ended Project-Based Learning (PBL) remains unexplored. This paper introduces a two-year longitudinal study comparing a 2024 (using early free LLMs, $n$=48) and 2025 (using the latest paid LLMs, $n$=46) cohort. Our findings suggest the latest powerful LLMs' dual role: they act as \"equalizers,\" boosting average performance even for programming-weak students, providing opportunities for more authentic SE practices; yet also as \"amplifiers,\" dramatically widening absolute performance gaps, creating new pedagogical challenges for addressing educational inequities."}

Despite notable advancements in GUI testing and static call graph construction, current tools are insufficient for reliably driving execution toward specific target methods, especially those not embedded in a graphical component (e.g., libraries' methods), a capability essential for tasks such as vulnerability validation, debugging, and behavioral analysis.\n  We present GAPS (Graph-based Automated Path Synthesizer), the first system that integrates static, method-guided call graph analysis with dynamic, interaction-driven execution. GAPS performs a lightweight backward traversal of the call graph, guided by data-flow analysis, to reconstruct paths reaching the target methods. These paths are then translated into instructions that guide runtime app exploration.\n  On the AndroTest benchmark, GAPS statically identifies paths to reach 88.24\\% of the target methods in just 4.27 seconds per app and dynamically reaches 57.44\\% of them. In contrast, state-of-the-art dynamic interaction tools show significantly lower reachability over three runs: APE, one of the best model-based GUI testers, achieves 12.82\\%, while GoalExplorer, a hybrid analysis tool, reaches 9.69\\%, and Guardian, an LLM-based UI automator, reaches 17.12\\%. Static analysis tools also fall short: FlowDroid and DroidReach identify paths to reach 58.81\\% and 9.48\\% of the targets, requiring 35.06 seconds and 23.46 seconds per app, respectively.\n  Finally, an evaluation on the 50 most downloaded real-world apps demonstrates GAPS's practical utility in analyzing security-critical code under a realistic scenario. With an average static analysis time of 278.9 seconds, GAPS statically reconstructs paths to 62.03\\% of the target methods and dynamically reaches 59.86\\% of them."}

However, MBFL faces significant challenges due to interference mutants generated from non-faulty code entities but can be killed by failing tests. These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability. The recognized FLIMs are then mitigated by refining the suspiciousness scores calculated from MBFL techniques. We integrate FLIM recognition and mitigation into the MBFL workflow, developing MBFL-FLIM, a fault localization framework that enhances MBFL's effectiveness by reducing misleading interference while preserving real fault-revealing information. Our empirical experiments on the Defects4J benchmark with 395 program versions using eight LLMs demonstrate MBFL-FLIM's superiority over traditional SBFL and MBFL methods, advanced dynamic feature-based approaches, and recent LLM-based fault localization techniques. Specifically, MBFL-FLIM achieves an average improvement of 44 faults in the Top-1 metric, representing a significant enhancement over baseline methods. Further evaluation confirms MBFL-FLIM's robust performance in multi-fault scenarios, with ablation experiments validating the contributions of the fine-tuning and confidence estimation components."}

While recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve chart representation, existing approaches still struggle to achieve cross-type generalization, memory efficiency, and modular design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2C-MoLA, a multimodal framework that synergizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The MoE component uses a complexity-aware routing mechanism with domain-specialized experts and load-balanced sparse gating, dynamically allocating inputs based on learnable structural metrics like element count and chart complexity. LoRA enables parameter-efficient updates for resource-conscious tuning, further supported by a tailored training strategy that aligns routing stability with semantic accuracy. Experiments on Chart2Code-160k show that the proposed model improves generation accuracy by up to 17%, reduces peak GPU memory by 18%, and accelerates convergence by 20%, when compared to standard fine-tuning and LoRA-only baselines, particularly on complex charts. Ablation studies validate optimal designs, such as 8 experts and rank-8 LoRA, and confirm scalability for real-world multimodal code generation."}
