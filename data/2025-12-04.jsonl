Existing autoscaling policies, often retrofitted from monolithic systems like those in AIBrix and DistServe, rely on lagging indicators such as GPU utilization or coarse-grained request counts. This results in slow reactions to load spikes, leading to significant Time-to First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) SLO violations and costly over-provisioning. We introduce TokenScale, an autoscaling framework that resolves this performance mismatch through two innovations. First, we propose Token Velocity, a novel metric that unifies the prefill, network, and decode stages by quantifying their rate of work. As a leading indicator of system backpressure, it enables proactive scaling. Second, Convertible Decoders allow decoder GPUs to dynamically execute prefill tasks during traffic spikes, creating a rapid-response buffer that absorbs bursts and eliminates the initialization latency of new prefillers. Our evaluation on a GPU cluster with production traces shows TokenScale improves SLO attainment from 50-88% to 80-96% and reduces costs by 4-14% over state-of-the-art systems, including DistServe, BlitzScale, and AIBrix. By uniting a predictive metric with a flexible system design, TokenScale significantly boosts the performance and efficiency of disaggregated LLM serving infrastructure."}

Although it is increasingly adopted, are vibe coding outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues.

Partial computation workloads of MASSs can be offloaded to both UAVs and the LEO satellite, concurrently, for processing via a multi-access approach. To minimize the energy consumption of SAMINs under latency constraints, we formulate an optimization problem and propose energy efficient algorithms to jointly optimize offloading mode, offloading volume, and computing resource allocation of the LEO satellite and the UAVs, respectively.

Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption."}

Prior detailed routers achieve state-of-the-art results by leveraging iterative pathfinding algorithms to route each net. However, runtimes are a major issue in detailed routers, as converging to a solution with zero design rule violations (DRVs) can be prohibitively expensive.\n  In this paper, we propose leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to enable rapid convergence in detailed routing by learning from previous designs. We make the key observation that prior detailed routers statically schedule the cost weights used in their routing algorithms, meaning they do not change in response to the design or technology. By training a conservative Q-learning (CQL) model to dynamically select the routing cost weights which minimize the number of algorithm iterations, we find that our work completes the ISPD19 benchmarks with 1.56x average and up to 3.01x faster runtime than the baseline router while maintaining or improving the DRV count in all cases. We also find that this learning shows signs of generalization across technologies, meaning that learning designs in one technology can translate to improved outcomes in other technologies."}

The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed."}

However, with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters, single-batch autoregressive inference suffers from extremely low arithmetic intensity, creating severe weight-loading and bandwidth pressures on resource-constrained platforms. Recent in-flash computing (IFC) solutions alleviate this bottleneck by co-locating weight-related linear computations in the decode phase with flash, yet still rely on DRAM for the key-value (KV) cache. As context length grows, the KV cache can exceed model weights in size, imposing prohibitive DRAM cost and capacity requirements. Attempts to offload KV cache to flash suffer from severe performance penalties.\n  We propose KVNAND, the first DRAM-free, IFC-based architecture that stores both model weights and KV cache entirely in compute-enabled 3D NAND flash. KVNAND addresses the fundamental performance challenges of flash under intensive KV cache access by leveraging IFC for all memory-bound operations to reduce data transfer overhead, introducing head-group parallelism to boost throughput, and employing page-level KV cache mapping to align token access patterns with flash organization. In addition, we propose a design space exploration framework that evaluates discrete and compact KVNAND variants to balance weight and KV placement, automatically identifying the optimal design trade-off. These techniques mitigate latency, energy, and reliability concerns, turning flash into a practical medium for long-context KV storage.

This study proposes the Enterprise Data Science Platform (EDSP), which builds on data lakehouse architecture and follows a Write-Once, Read-Anywhere principle. EDSP enables federated data access for multi-query engine environments, targeting data science workloads with periodic data updates and query response times ranging from seconds to minutes. By providing centralized data management with federated access from multiple query engines to the same data sources, EDSP eliminates data duplication and vendor lock-in inherent in traditional data warehouses. The platform employs a four-layer architecture: Data Preparation, Data Store, Access Interface, and Query Engines. This design enforces separation of concerns and reduces the need for data migration when integrating additional analytical environments. Experimental results demonstrate that major cloud data warehouses and programming environments can directly query EDSP-managed datasets. We implemented and deployed EDSP in production, confirming interoperability across multiple query engines. For data sharing across different analytical environments, EDSP achieves a 33-44% reduction in operational steps compared with conventional approaches requiring data migration. Although query latency may increase by up to a factor of 2.6 compared with native tables, end-to-end completion times remain on the order of seconds, maintaining practical performance for analytical use cases.

We, therefore, propose a) a unified hash engine supporting Sha-3 and Shake that follows a byte-wise in-place partitioning mechanism of the so-called Keccak state, and b) an according fault detection for Keccak state protection exploiting its cube structure by deploying two-dimensional parity checks. It outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoA) regarding area requirements at competitive register-level fault detection by achieving 100% detection of three and still near 100% of higher numbers of Keccak state faults. Unlike SoA solutions, the proposed unified hash engine covers all standard hash configurations. Moreover, the introduced multidimensional cross-parity check mechanism achieves a 3.7x improvement in area overhead, with an overall 4.5x smaller fault-resilient engine design as demonstrated in ASIC and FPGA implementations.

Computationally, this imposes a significant slow-down, which can be counteracted by means of parallelization. These schemes enable MCMC/PT techniques to be run more effectively and allow larger models to be studied. In this work, we present a parallel implementation of Metropolis-Hastings with Parallel Tempering, using OpenMP and CUDA for the parallelization in modern CPUs and GPUs, respectively. The results show a maximum speed-up of 52x using OpenMP with 48 cores, and of 986x speed-up with the CUDA version. Furthermore, the results serve as a basic benchmark to compare a future quantum implementation of the same algorithm."}

We introduce ExOAR (Expert-Guided Object and Activity Recognition), an interactive method that combines large language models (LLMs) with human verification to identify objects and activities from textual data. ExOAR guides users through consecutive stages in which an LLM generates candidate object types, activities, and object instances based on contextual input, such as a user's profession, and textual data. Users review and refine these suggestions before proceeding to the next stage. Implemented as a practical tool, ExOAR is initially validated through a demonstration and then evaluated with real-world Active Window Tracking data from five users. Our results show that ExOAR can effectively bridge the gap between unstructured textual data and the structured log with clear semantics needed for object-centric process analysis, while it maintains flexibility and human oversight."}

Such optimization becomes unfeasible when it is focused on a global search requiring thousands of simulations to be evaluated. Here, we present a viable global shape optimization methodology based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms accelerated by deep neural networks (DNNs). Our methodology alternates between evaluating simulations and utilizing the generated data to train DNNs with various architectures. When a suitable DNN architecture is identified, the DNN replaces the simulation in the rest of the global search. Our methodology was tested on five ZDT benchmark functions, showing itself at the level of and sometimes more flexible than other state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Then, it was applied to a real-life optimization problem, namely the shape optimization of a single-phase ejector. Compared with a non-accelerated methodology, ours was able to save weeks of CPU time in solving this problem. To experimentally confirm the performance of the optimized ejector shapes, four of them were 3D printed and tested on the lab scale confirming the predicted performance. This suggests that our methodology could be used for acceleration of other real-life shape optimization problems."}

Among the transmission technologies operating in unlicensed bands available to this purpose, Wi-Fi is certainly one of the most interesting, because of its high performance and the relatively low deployment costs. Unfortunately, its dependability is often deemed unsuitable for real-time control systems. In this paper, the use of parallel redundancy is evaluated from a quantitative viewpoint, by considering a number of performance indices that are relevant for soft real-time applications. Analysis is carried out on a large dataset acquired from a real setup, to provide realistic insights on the advantages this kind of approaches can provide. As will be seen, deferred parallel redundancy provides clear advantages in terms of the worst-case transmission latency, at limited costs concerning the amount of consumed spectrum. Hence, it can be practically exploited every time a wireless connection is included in a control loop."}

Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era."}

However, existing studies have overemphasized specialized numerical modelling, making the professional output challenging to understand and use by non-research stakeholders. In this context, this article proposes a 3D virtual geographic environment for flood representation towards risk communication, which integrates flood modelling, parallel computation, and 3D representation in a pipeline. Finally, a section of the Rhine River in Bonn, Germany, is selected for experiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of flood modelling and 3D representation within a few hours, the parallel speedup ratio reached 6.45. The intuitive flood scene with 3D city models is beneficial for promoting flood risk communication and is particularly helpful for participants without direct experience of floods to understand its spatiotemporal process. It also can be embedded in the Geospatial Infrastructure Management Ecosystem (GeoIME) cloud application for intelligent flood systems."}

At the same time, these systems must maintain a certain level of determinism to ensure reliable and predictable operation. In this view, time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) is a communication technology that meets both conditions, making it an attractive option for its usage in industrial WSNs. This work proposes the use of machine learning to learn the traffic pattern generated in networks based on the TSCH protocol, in order to turn nodes into a deep sleep state when no transmission is planned and thus to improve the energy efficiency of the WSN. The ability of machine learning models to make good predictions at different network levels in a typical tree network topology was analyzed in depth, showing how their capabilities degrade while approaching the root of the tree. The application of these models on simulated data based on an accurate modeling of wireless sensor nodes indicates that the investigated algorithms can be suitably used to further and substantially reduce the power consumption of a TSCH network."}

This work explores various techniques for SIMD vectorization to improve the pairwise force calculation between molecules in the scope of the particle simulation library AutoPas. The focus lies on the order in which particle values are loaded into vector registers to achieve the most optimal performance regarding execution time or energy consumption.\n  As previous work indicates that the optimal MD algorithm can change during runtime, this paper investigates simulation-specific parameters like particle density and the impact of the neighbor identification algorithms, which distinguishes this work from related projects. Furthermore, AutoPas' dynamic tuning mechanism is extended to choose the optimal vectorization order during runtime.\n  The benchmarks show that considering different particle interaction orders during runtime can lead to a considerable performance improvement for the force calculation compared to AutoPas' previous approach."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm with exceptional capabilities in knowledge generalization, contextual reasoning, and interactive generation, which have demonstrated strong potential to enhance classical RL. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on LLM-enhanced RL for wireless networks. We propose a taxonomy to categorize the roles of LLMs into four critical functions: state perceiver, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. Then, we review existing studies exploring how each role of LLMs enhances different stages of the RL pipeline. Moreover, we provide a series of case studies to illustrate how to design and apply LLM-enhanced RL in low-altitude economy networking, vehicular networks, and space-air-ground integrated networks. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for LLM-enhanced RL and offer insights into its future development in wireless networks."}
