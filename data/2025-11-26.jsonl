While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers."}

Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability."}

Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities.\n  Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \\textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \\textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}. L8 formalizes the \\textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP.

Consequently, memory competition leads to inevitable page swapping in memory-constrained mixed-criticality edge devices, causing slow storage I/O and thus performance degradation. In such scenarios, inefficient memory allocation disrupts the balance between application performance, causing soft real-time (soft RT) tasks to miss deadlines or preventing non-real-time (non-RT) applications from optimizing throughput. Meanwhile, we observe unpredictable, long system-level stalls (called long stalls) under high memory and I/O pressure, which further degrade performance. In this work, we propose a Stall-Aware Real-Time Memory Allocator (SARA), which discovers opportunities for performance balance by allocating just enough memory to soft RT tasks to meet deadlines and, at the same time, optimizing the remaining memory for non-RT applications. To minimize the memory usage of soft RT tasks while meeting real-time requirements, SARA leverages our insight into how latency, caused by memory insufficiency and measured by our proposed PSI-based metric, affects the execution time of each soft RT job, where a job runs per period and a soft RT task consists of multiple periods. Moreover, SARA detects long stalls using our definition and proactively drops affected jobs, minimizing stalls in task execution. Experiments show that SARA achieves an average of 97.13% deadline hit ratio for soft RT tasks and improves non-RT application throughput by up to 22.32x over existing approaches, even with memory capacity limited to 60% of peak demand."}

This study investigates the PINN loss landscape to identify the failure mechanisms of two primary formulations: the high-order strong formulation and the energy-based formulation. The results demonstrate that the Strong Formulation suffers from landscape ill-conditioning driven by the boundary conditions (BCs), leading to convergence issues in the doubly-clamped case. Conversely, while the energy-based formulation requires only lower-order derivatives, its loss functional can become indefinite, causing optimization difficulties near saddle points. Based on strain field benchmarks against Finite Element Method (FEM), it is found that the strong formulation, combined with a BC handling method and the L-BFGS optimizer, yields the best performance across three classical boundary condition cases. These findings clarify distinct, formulation-dependent failure modes, offering a diagnostic foundation for developing robust physics-based surrogate models for complex beam systems."}

Standard sparse grids offer a powerful solution by mitigating the curse of dimensionality compared to full tensor grids. However, they treat all regions of the domain isotropically, which may not be efficient for functions with localized or anisotropic behavior. This work presents a surrogate-informed framework for constructing sparse grid interpolants, which is guided by an error indicator that serves as a zero-cost estimate for the hierarchical surplus. This indicator is calculated for all candidate points, defined as those in the next-level grid $w+1$ not already present in the base grid $w$. It quantifies the local approximation error by measuring the relative difference between the predictions of two consecutive interpolants of level $w$ and $w-1$. The candidates are then ranked by this metric to select the most impactful points for refinement up to a given budget or following another criterion, as, e.g., a given threshold in the error indicator. The final higher-order model is then constructed using a surrogate-informed approach: the objective function is evaluated only at the selected high-priority points, while for the remaining nodes of the $w+1$ grid, we assign the values predicted by the initial $w$-level surrogate. This strategy significantly reduces the required number of expensive evaluations, yielding a final model that closely approximates the accuracy of a fully-resolved $w+1$ grid at a fraction of the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed surrogate-informed refinement criterion is demonstrated for several analytic function and for a real engineering problem, i.e., the analysis of sensitivity to geometrical parameters of numerically predicted flashback phenomenon in hydrogen-fueled perforated burners."}

With the introduction of 5G, the support of UL-256QAM has been greatly improved due to a big re-haul of RAN by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, many RAN manufacturers charge MNOs for licenses to enable UL-256QAM per cell basis. This led to some MNOs hesitating to enable the feature on some of their gNodeB or cells to save cost.\n  Since it's known that 256QAM modulation requires a very good channel condition to operate, but UE has a very limited transmission power budget. In this paper, 256QAM utilization, throughput and latency impact from enabling UL-256QAM will be evaluated on commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in two countries: Japan and Thailand on various frequency bands, mobility characteristics, and deployment schemes. By modifying the modem firmware, UL-256QAM can be turned off and compared to the conventional UL-64QAM. The results show that UL-256QAM utilization was less than 20% when deployed on a passive antenna network resulting in an average of 8.22% improvement in throughput. However, with Massive MIMO deployment, more than 50% utilization was possible on commercial networks. Furthermore, despite a small uplink throughput gain, enabling UL-256QAM can lower the latency when the link is fully loaded with an average improvement of 7.97 ms in TCP latency observed across various test cases with two TCP congestion control algorithms."}

Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\\% lower latency, and 20\\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines. These results confirm that predictive, deterministic, and security-aware shard allocation is a promising direction for next-generation scalable blockchain systems."}

On-device searches, such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search and radius search, are commonly used to enable fast analytics and learning technologies, such as k-means dataset simplification using kNN. To maintain high search efficiency, a representative approach is to utilize a balanced multi-way KD-tree (BMKD-tree). However, the index has shown limited gains, mainly due to substantial construction overhead, inflexibility to real-time insertion, and inconsistent query performance. In this paper, we propose UnIS to address the above limitations. We first accelerate the construction process of the BMKD-tree by utilizing the dataset distribution to predict the splitting hyperplanes. To make the continuously generated data searchable, we propose a selective sub-tree rebuilding scheme to accelerate rebalancing during insertion by reducing the number of data points involved. We then propose an auto-selection model to improve query performance by automatically selecting the optimal search strategy among multiple strategies for an arbitrary query task.

However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks. This framework has been deployed in the Eleme platform's technical division, serving large-scale test data generation scenarios across multiple business units including Taotian, Gaode, and Hema. Production data demonstrates that the system reduces average token consumption in tool inference by 96.26\\% while achieving a 92\\% tool invocation accuracy rate, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of intelligent test data generation systems."}

Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability.

While edge-DP, which protects privacy at the edge level, has been extensively studied, node-DP, offering stronger protection for entire nodes and their incident edges, remains largely underexplored due to its technical challenges. A natural way to bridge this gap is to develop a general framework for reducing node-DP graph analytical tasks to edge-DP ones, enabling the reuse of existing edge-DP mechanisms. A straightforward solution based on group privacy divides the privacy budget by a given degree upper bound, but this leads to poor utility when the bound is set conservatively large to accommodate worst-case inputs. To address this, we propose node-to-edge (N2E), a general framework that reduces any node-DP graph analytical task to an edge-DP one, with the error dependency on the graph's true maximum degree. N2E introduces two novel techniques: a distance-preserving clipping mechanism that bounds edge distance between neighboring graphs after clipping, and the first node-DP mechanism for maximum degree approximation, enabling tight, privacy-preserving clipping thresholds. By instantiating N2E with existing edge-DP mechanisms, we obtain the first node-DP solutions for tasks such as maximum degree estimation. For edge counting, our method theoretically matches the error of the state-of-the-art, which is provably optimal, and significantly outperforms existing approaches for degree distribution estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves up to a 2.5x reduction in error for edge counting and up to an 80x reduction for degree distribution estimation."}

We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems.

Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput.

We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level \"purpose\" inconsistencies.

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution."}

The prototype delivers predictable real-time ingest, fast selective retrieval, and substantial footprint reduction under modest resource budgets. The work also outlines observations and next steps toward more scalable and longer deployments to motivate storage as a first-class component in AV stacks."}

In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity. Building on the batch solution, we further optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in delivering high-quality, lower-latency AIGC services."}

These agents, modelled as autonomous physical or software entities, possess local computation power, finite memory and have the ability to traverse a graph, offering efficient solutions to a range of classical problems. In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \\emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \\emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework."}

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup."}

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs."}
