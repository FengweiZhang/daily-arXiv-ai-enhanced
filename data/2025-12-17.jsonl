Nevertheless, providing high-speed internet access in these regions is essential to promote digital inclusion. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its one-hop topology limits coverage. To overcome this limitation, a multi-hop architecture is required. This work proposes a unified multi-hop framework that integrates long-haul microwave, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), and FWA to provide wide coverage and high capacity in rural areas. As the number of hops increases, total energy consumption also rises, a challenge often overlooked in existing literature. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient multi-radio microwave and IAB-based FWA framework for rural area connectivity. When the network is underutilized, the proposed approach dynamically operates at reduced capacity to minimize energy consumption. We optimize the off, start-up, serving, deep sleep, and wake-up sates of microwave radios to balance energy use and satisfying data rate requirements. Additionally, we optimize resource block allocation for IAB-based FWA nodes connected to microwave backhaul. The formulated optimization problems aim to minimize the energy consumption of long-haul microwave and multi-hop IAB-based network while satisfying data rate constraints. These problems are solved using dual decomposition and multi-convex programming, supported by dynamic programming. Simulation results demonstrates"}

Because these services directly influence public trust, any disruption can have significant societal and political consequences. Yet their supporting infrastructures remain vulnerable to outages from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and targeted attacks. Central to their operation is the authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, the single source of truth that maps government domain names to service endpoints. While indispensable, this infrastructure also represents a potential and critical point of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework with purpose-designed mechanisms to systematically evaluate the operational resilience of authoritative DNS infrastructure supporting government services. Complementing prior studies on website hosting, recursive resolution, and DNS record integrity, our work provides a holistic view of authoritative DNS operation. Our first contribution develops a multi-sourced data schema that characterizes a (government) domain's authoritative DNS infrastructure across four hierarchical levels: physical hosting infrastructure, server functionality, name servers, and individual hosting instances. Using data collected from six representative countries, our second contribution identifies resilience attributes at their finest applicable hierarchy across three operational phases: infrastructure placement, service configuration, and DNS record dispatch. Our method assigns numerical scores to each attribute and aggregates them algorithmically to enable consistent and cross-domain comparisons. We apply our method to government domains in the six countries, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in authoritative DNS resilience and pinpointing operational practices that require improvement."}

Finding these CitMs raises daunting methodological challenges. We propose a framework to identify CitMs and use a pilot study of 149 countries to refine our methodology before conducting an in-depth measurement study of 11 countries. For our focused study, we compile an extensive set of websites hosting government services and analyze over 9,000 IP-level paths from vantage points in those countries to these services. We conduct extensive manual validation to corroborate or discard paths based on the aforementioned challenges, and discuss paths that experience unexpected CitMs."}

These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.\n  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.\n  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.\n  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required.

To address these challenges, we formulate a Deadline-Constrained Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Problem (DOAP), denoted as $\\mathbf{P}$, in VEC with both bandwidth and computational resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total vehicle utility.

These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites."}

Traditional event data models, also called case-centric, are unable to cope with the complexity introduced by these more refined relationships. Several models have been made to move from case-centric to Object-Centric Event Data (OCED), trying to retain simplicity as much as possible. Still, these suffer from inherent ambiguities, and lack a comprehensive support of essential dimensions related to time and (dynamic) relations. In this work, we propose to fill this gap by leveraging a well-founded ontology of events and bringing ontological foundations to OCED, with a three-step approach. First, we start from key open issues reported in the literature regarding current OCED metamodels, and witness their ambiguity and expressiveness limitations on illustrative and representative examples proposed therein. Second, we consider the OCED Core Model, currently proposed as the basis for defining a new standard for object-centric event data, and we enhance it by grounding it on a lightweight version of UFO-B called gUFO, a well-known foundational ontology tailored to the representation of objects, events, time, and their (dynamic) relations. This results in a new metamodel, which we call gOCED. The third contribution then shows how gOCED at once covers the features of existing metamodels preserving their simplicity, and extends them with the essential features needed to overcome the ambiguity and expressiveness issues reported in the literature."}

However, the corresponding models often operate as black boxes, leading them to unintentionally act unfairly towards different demographic groups. This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models. Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps. This highlights the need for agreement with relevant stakeholders on well-defined, contextually appropriate fairness definitions, the corresponding evaluation metrics, and formalized processes to better integrate fairness into AI/ML projects."}

These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems."}

We consider hybrid players where the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs) are augmented by vehicular-UAV agent pairs (AgPs) that can be proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots. Unique key challenges should be addressed: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HuUs) and machine users (MaUs). To cope with these issues, we propose FUSION, a two-stage framework that tightly couples service demand prediction, agent deployment, and task scheduling. In the offline stage, a Pro-LNN module performs intelligent multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme (eACO-VRP) and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism (Off-AIC^2), to jointly determine ES-AgP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate congestion-aware task scheduling as an potential game among HuUs, MaUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAV providers, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics (PG-BR) algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications. The results demonstrate that existing solutions have an SLA violation rate of up to 23%, whereas the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the baselines with an SLA violation rate of only 6%, ensuring stable SLA compliance across various applications."}

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs."}

This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives."}

Wafer-scale chips (WSCs) provide high computation power and die-to-die (D2D) bandwidth but face a unique trade-off between on-chip memory and compute resources due to limited wafer area. Therefore, tensor parallelism strategies for wafer should leverage communication advantages while maintaining memory efficiency to maximize WSC performance. However, existing approaches fail to address these challenges.\n  To address these challenges, we propose the tensor stream partition paradigm (TSPP), which reveals an opportunity to leverage WSCs' abundant communication bandwidth to alleviate stringent on-chip memory constraints. However, the 2D mesh topology of WSCs lacks long-distance and flexible interconnects, leading to three challenges: 1) severe tail latency, 2) prohibitive D2D traffic contention, and 3) intractable search time for optimal design.\n  We present TEMP, a framework for LLM training on WSCs that leverages topology-aware tensor-stream partition, traffic-conscious mapping, and dual-level wafer solving to overcome hardware constraints and parallelism challenges. These integrated approaches optimize memory efficiency and throughput, unlocking TSPP's full potential on WSCs. Evaluations show TEMP achieves 1.7x average throughput improvement over state-of-the-art LLM training systems across various models."}

While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland)."}

However, such numerical simulations are computationally expensive, limiting the real-world practical application of the framework. To address this issue, previous studies have used machine learning to predict the structural responses to ground motions with low computational costs. These studies typically conduct NLTHAs for a few hundreds ground motions and use the results to train and validate surrogate models. However, most of the previous studies focused on computationally-inexpensive response analysis models such as single degree of freedom. Surrogate models of high-fidelity response analysis are required to enrich the quantity and diversity of information used for damage assessment in PBEE. Notably, the computational cost of creating training and validation datasets increases if the fidelity of response analysis model becomes higher. Therefore, methods that enable surrogate modeling of high-fidelity response analysis without a large number of training samples are needed. This study proposes a framework that uses transfer learning to construct the surrogate model of a high-fidelity response analysis model. This framework uses a surrogate model of low-fidelity response analysis as the pretrained model and transfers its knowledge to construct surrogate models for high-fidelity response analysis with substantially reduced computational cost. As a case study, surrogate models that predict responses of a 20-story steel moment frame were constructed with only 20 samples as the training dataset. The responses to the ground motions predicted by constructed surrogate model were consistent with a site-specific time-based hazard."}

The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines."}

Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency.\n  This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria.\n  We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA."}

Here, we develop a data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs an individual stroke survivor's neuromuscular control from a single 20 m level-ground walking trial and predicts task-conditioned locomotion across rehabilitation scenarios. The system combines wearable-sensor kinematics, a proportional-derivative physics controller, a population Healthy Motion Atlas, and goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning with behaviour cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning to generate physically plausible, patient-specific gait simulations for slopes and stairs. In 11 stroke survivors, the personalized controllers preserved idiosyncratic gait patterns while improving joint-angle and endpoint fidelity by 4.73% and 12.10%, respectively, and reducing training time to 25.56% relative to a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot involving 21 inpatients, clinicians who used our locomotion predictions to guide task selection and difficulty obtained larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores over 28 days of standard rehabilitation than control clinicians (mean change 6.0 versus 3.7 points). These findings indicate that our generative, task-predictive framework can augment clinical decision-making in post-stroke gait rehabilitation and provide a template for dynamically personalized motor recovery strategies."}

We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance."}

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation."}

We report on our longitudinal study at Siemens AG, consisting of several individual sub-studies in the inception, validation, and initial adoption of our framework based on RefA as well as the implications for practice. RefA is a prescriptive model of a security compliant DevOps lifecycle based on the IEC 62443-4-1 standard. The overall framework is aimed at professionals, not only security experts, being able to use it on implementing DevOps processes while remaining compliant with security norms.

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381"}

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems."}
