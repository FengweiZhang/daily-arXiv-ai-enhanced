Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of minimizing total energy consumption for secure federated learning (FL) in wireless edge networks, a key paradigm for decentralized big data analytics. To tackle the high computational cost and privacy challenges of processing large-scale distributed data with conventional neural networks, we propose an FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. Each edge device employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for lightweight local training and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model updates. The total energy consumption is minimized through a joint optimization of the HDC dimension, transmit power, and CPU frequency. An efficient hybrid algorithm is developed, combining an outer enumeration search for HDC dimensions with an inner one-dimensional search for resource allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 83.3% energy reduction compared with baseline schemes, while maintaining high accuracy and faster convergence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce the concept of engineered simultaneity: a system design that (1) requires comparing events at spacelike-separated locations, (2) implements this comparison via an implicit simultaneity convention, and (3) represents the result as objective rather than conventional. The United States National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), mandated by SEC Regulation NMS Rule 611, is shown to be an instance of engineered simultaneity. We prove that the NBBO is frame-dependent: its value depends on the reference frame in which "current" prices are defined. Since the exchanges that generate quote data are separated by distances of 43-1,180 km, light-travel times of 143-3,940 microseconds create unavoidable windows during which no frame-independent price ordering exists. High-frequency trading firms exploit this window by accessing exchange data via direct feeds (latency ~tens of microseconds) while the consolidated Securities Information Processor operates at ~1,128 microseconds -- a ratio exceeding 50:1. We demonstrate that this constitutes a category mistake in the sense of Ryle: the NBBO applies the concept of "simultaneity" in a domain where it has no frame-independent meaning. The resulting information asymmetry extracts approximately $5 billion annually from other market participants.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Enabling efficient, high-performance data access in parallel file systems (PFS) is critical for today's high-performance computing systems. PFS client-side I/O heavily impacts the final I/O performance delivered to individual applications and the entire system. Autotuning the key client-side I/O behaviors has been extensively studied and shows promising results. However, existing work has heavily relied on extensive number of global runtime metrics to monitor and accurate modeling of applications' I/O patterns. Such heavy overheads significantly limit the ability to enable fine-grained, dynamic tuning in practical systems. In this study, we propose DIAL (Decentralized I/O AutoTuning via Learned Client-side Local Metrics) which takes a drastically different approach. Instead of trying to extract the global I/O patterns of applications, DIAL takes a decentralized approach, treating each I/O client as an independent unit and tuning configurations using only its locally observable metrics. With the help of machine learning models, DIAL enables multiple tunable units to make independent but collective decisions, reacting to what is happening in the global storage systems in a timely manner and achieving better I/O performance globally for the application.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) applications run on compute resources but share global storage systems. This design can cause problems when applications consume a disproportionate amount of storage bandwidth relative to their allocated compute resources. For example, an application running on a single compute node can issue many small, random writes and consume excessive I/O bandwidth from a storage server. This can hinder larger jobs that write to the same storage server and are allocated many compute nodes, resulting in significant resource waste.
  A straightforward solution is to limit each application's I/O bandwidth on storage servers in proportion to its allocated compute resources. This approach has been implemented in parallel file systems using Token Bucket Filter (TBF). However, strict proportional limits often reduce overall I/O efficiency because HPC applications generate short, bursty I/O. Limiting bandwidth can waste server capacity when applications are idle or prevent applications from temporarily using higher bandwidth during bursty phases.
  We argue that I/O control should maximize per-application performance and overall storage efficiency while ensuring fairness (e.g., preventing small jobs from blocking large-scale ones). We propose AdapTBF, which builds on TBF in modern parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre) and introduces a decentralized bandwidth control approach using adaptive borrowing and lending. We detail the algorithm, implement AdapTBF in Lustre, and evaluate it using synthetic workloads modeled after real-world scenarios. Results show that AdapTBF manages I/O bandwidth effectively while maintaining high storage utilization, even under extreme conditions.

Abstract: Machine learning training pipelines consume data in batches. A single training step may require thousands of samples drawn from shards distributed across a storage cluster. Issuing thousands of individual GET requests incurs per-request overhead that often dominates data transfer time. To solve this problem, we introduce GetBatch - a new object store API that elevates batch retrieval to a first-class storage operation, replacing independent GET operations with a single deterministic, fault-tolerant streaming execution. GetBatch achieves up to 15x throughput improvement for small objects and, in a production training workload, reduces P95 batch retrieval latency by 2x and P99 per-object tail latency by 3.7x compared to individual GET requests.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tuning parallel file system in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems remains challenging due to the complex I/O paths, diverse I/O patterns, and dynamic system conditions. While existing autotuning frameworks have shown promising results in tuning PFS parameters based on applications' I/O patterns, they lack scalability, adaptivity, and the ability to operate online. In this work, focusing on scalable online tuning, we present CARAT, an ML-guided framework to co-tune client-side RPC and caching parameters of PFS, leveraging only locally observable metrics. Unlike global or pattern-dependent approaches, CARAT enables each client to make independent and intelligent tuning decisions online, responding to real-time changes in both application I/O behaviors and system states. We then prototyped CARAT using Lustre and evaluated it extensively across dynamic I/O patterns, real-world HPC workloads, and multi-client deployments. The results demonstrated that CARAT can achieve up to 3x performance improvement over the default or static configurations, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach. Due to its scalability and lightweight, we believe CARAT has the potential to be widely deployed into existing PFS and benefit various data-intensive applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), also known as ZeRO, is widely used for training large-scale models, featuring its flexibility and minimal intrusion on model code. However, current FSDP systems struggle with structure-aware training methods (e.g., block-wise quantized training) and with non-element-wise optimizers (e.g., Shampoo and Muon) used in cutting-edge models (e.g., Gemini, Kimi K2). FSDP's fixed element- or row-wise sharding formats conflict with the block-structured computations. In addition, today's implementations fall short in communication and memory efficiency, limiting scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs. We introduce veScale-FSDP, a redesigned FSDP system that couples a flexible sharding format, RaggedShard, with a structure-aware planning algorithm to deliver both flexibility and performance at scale. veScale-FSDP natively supports efficient data placement required by FSDP, empowering block-wise quantization and non-element-wise optimizers. As a result, veScale-FSDP achieves 5~66% higher throughput and 16~30% lower memory usage than existing FSDP systems, while scaling efficiently to tens of thousands of GPUs.

Abstract: Implementations of Broadcast based on some information dissemination algorithm -- e.g., gossip or tree-based communication -- followed by a correction algorithm has been proposed previously. This work describes an approach to apply a similar idea to Reduce. In it, a correction-like communication phase precedes a tree-based phase. This provides a Reduce algorithm which is tolerant to a number of failed processes. Semantics of the resulting algorithm are provided and proven.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) training or inference across multiple nodes introduces significant pressure on GPU memory and interconnect bandwidth. The Compute Express Link (CXL) shared memory pool offers a scalable solution by enabling memory sharing across nodes, reducing over-provisioning and improving resource utilization. We propose \name, a collective communication library, leveraging the CXL shared memory pool to support cross-node GPU operations without relying on traditional RDMA-based networking. Our design addresses the challenges on synchronization, data interleaving, and communication parallelization faced by using the CXL shared memory pool for collective communications. Evaluating on multiple nodes with a TITAN-II CXL switch and six Micron CZ120 memory cards, we show that \name achieves highly efficient collective operations across hosts, demonstrating CXL's potential for scalable, memory-centric GPU communication. Our evaluation demonstrates that \name achieves average performance improvements of 1.34$\times$ for AllGather, 1.84$\times$ for Broadcast, 1.94$\times$ for Gather, and 1.04$\times$ for Scatter, compared to the original RDMA-based implementation over 200 Gbps InfiniBand. \textcolor{dong}{In addition, the evaluation with a case of LLM training shows 1.11$\times$ speedup compared with the InfiniBand while saving production cost by $2.75\times$ in hardware.}

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Shuffle exchanges intermediate results between upstream and downstream operators in distributed data processing and is usually the bottleneck due to factors such as small random I/Os and network contention. Several systems have been designed to improve shuffle efficiency, but from our experiences of running ultra-large clusters at Alibaba Cloud MaxCompute platform, we observe that they can not adapt to highly dynamic job characteristics and cluster resource conditions, and their fault tolerance mechanisms are passive and inefficient when failures are inevitable. To tackle their limitations, we design and implement FuxiShuffle as a general data shuffle service for the ultra-large production environment of MaxCompute, featuring good adaptability and efficient failure resilience. Specifically, to achieve good adaptability, FuxiShuffle dynamically selects the shuffle mode based on runtime information, conducts progress-aware scheduling for the downstream workers, and automatically determines the most suitable backup strategy for each shuffle data chunk. To make failure resilience efficient, FuxiShuffle actively ensures data availability with multi-replica failover, prevents memory overflow with careful memory management, and employs an incremental recovery mechanism that does not lose computation progress. Our experiments show that, compared to baseline systems, FuxiShuffle significantly reduces not only end-to-end job completion time but also aggregate resource consumption. Micro experiments suggest that our designs are effective in improving adaptability and failure resilience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Production LLM serving must simultaneously deliver high throughput, low latency, and sufficient context capacity under non-stationary traffic and mixed request requirements. Data parallelism (DP) maximizes throughput by running independent replicas, while tensor parallelism (TP) reduces per-request latency and pools memory for long-context inference. However, existing serving stacks typically commit to a static parallelism configuration at deployment; adapting to bursts, priorities, or long-context requests is often disruptive and slow. We present Flying Serving, a vLLM-based system that enables online DP-TP switching without restarting engine workers. Flying Serving makes reconfiguration practical by virtualizing the state that would otherwise force data movement: (i) a zero-copy Model Weights Manager that exposes TP shard views on demand, (ii) a KV Cache Adaptor that preserves request KV state across DP/TP layouts, (iii) an eagerly initialized Communicator Pool to amortize collective setup, and (iv) a deadlock-free scheduler that coordinates safe transitions under execution skew. Across three popular LLMs and realistic serving scenarios, Flying Serving improves performance by up to $4.79\times$ under high load and $3.47\times$ under low load while supporting latency- and memory-driven requests.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires substantial compute and energy. At the same time, renewable energy sources regularly produce more electricity than the grid can absorb, leading to curtailment, the deliberate reduction of clean generation that would otherwise go to waste. These periods represent an opportunity: if training is aligned with curtailment windows, LLMs can be pretrained using electricity that is both clean and cheap. This technical report presents a system that performs full-parameter LLM training across geo-distributed GPU clusters during regional curtailment windows, elastically switching between local single-site training and federated multi-site synchronization as sites become available or unavailable. Our prototype trains a 561M-parameter transformer model across three clusters using the Flower federated learning framework, with curtailment periods derived from real-world marginal carbon intensity traces. Preliminary results show that curtailment-aware scheduling preserves training quality while reducing operational emissions to 5-12% of single-site baselines.

Abstract: This study targets cloud native environments where microservice invocation relations are complex, load fluctuations are multi-scale and superimposed, and cross-service impacts are significant. We propose a structured temporal joint load prediction framework oriented to microservice topology. The method represents the system as a coupled entity of a time-evolving service invocation graph and multivariate load sequences. It constructs neighborhood-aggregated and global summarized views based on service level observations. This forms layered load representations across instance, service, and cluster levels. A unified sequence encoder models multi-scale historical context. To strengthen the expression of invocation dependencies, the framework introduces a lightweight structural prior into attention computation. This enables more effective capture of load propagation and accumulation along invocation chains, while maintaining consistent modeling of local bursts and overall trends. The training objective adopts a multi-objective regression strategy that jointly optimizes service level and cluster level predictions to improve cross-granularity stability. We further conduct single-factor sensitivity analyses on key structural and training hyperparameters. We systematically examine the effects of time window length, encoding depth, and regularization strength. The results support the necessity of multi-granularity fusion and structural injection and clarify their effective configuration ranges. Overall, the framework provides a reusable modeling paradigm and implementation path for capacity assessment, resource orchestration, and runtime situational understanding in cloud environments.

Abstract: Modern multi-tenant, hardware-heterogeneous computing environments pose significant challenges for effective workload orchestration. Simple heuristics for assessing workload performance, such as CPU utilization or application-level metrics, are often insufficient to capture the complex performance dynamics arising from resource contention and noisy-neighbor effects. In such environments, performance bottlenecks may emerge in any shared system resource, leading to unexpected and difficult-to-diagnose degradation.
  This paper introduces buoyancy, a novel abstraction for characterizing workload performance in multi-tenant systems. Unlike traditional approaches, buoyancy integrates application-level metrics with system-level insights of shared resource contention to provide a holistic view of performance dynamics. By explicitly capturing bottlenecks and headroom across multiple resources, buoyancy facilitates resource-aware and application-aware orchestration in a manner that is intuitive, extensible, and generalizable across heterogeneous platforms. We evaluate buoyancy using representative multi-tenant workloads to illustrate its ability to expose performance-limiting resource interactions. Buoyancy provides a 19.3% better indication of bottlenecks compared to traditional heuristics on average. We additionally show how buoyancy can act as a drop-in replacement for conventional performance metrics, enabling improved observability and more informed scheduling and optimization decisions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A balanced separator of a graph $G$ is a set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph into connected components that are a constant factor smaller than $G$. Lipton and Tarjan [FOCS'77] famously proved that every planar graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\sqrt{n})$, as well as a balanced separator of size $O(D)$ that is a simple path (where $D$ is $G$'s diameter). In the centralized setting, both separators can be found in linear time. In the distributed setting, $D$ is a universal lower bound for the round complexity of solving many optimization problems, so, separators of size $O(D)$ are preferable.
  It was not until [DISC'17] that a distributed algorithm was devised by Ghaffari and Parter to compute such an $O(D)$-size separator in $\tilde O(D)$ rounds, by adapting the Lipton-Tarjan algorithm to the distributed model. Since then, this algorithm was used in several distributed algorithms for planar graphs, e.g., [GP, DISC'17], [LP, STOC'19], [AEDPW, PODC'25]. However, the algorithm is randomized, deeming the algorithms that use it to be randomized as well. Obtaining a deterministic algorithm remained an interesting open question until [PODC'25], when a (complex) deterministic separator algorithm was given by Jauregui, Montealegre and Rapaport.
  We present a much simpler deterministic separator algorithm with the same (near-optimal) $\tilde O(D)$-round complexity. While previous works devised either complicated or randomized ways of transferring weights from vertices to faces of $G$, we show that a straightforward way also works: Each vertex simply transfers its weight to one arbitrary face it lies on. That's it!
  We note that a deterministic separator algorithm directly derandomizes the state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for classical problems on planar graphs such as single-source shortest-paths, maximum-flow, directed global min-cut, and reachability.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) serving infrastructures are undergoing a shift toward heterogeneity and disaggregation. Modern deployments increasingly integrate diverse accelerators and near-memory processing technologies, introducing significant hardware heterogeneity, while system software increasingly separates computation, memory, and model components across distributed resources to improve scalability and efficiency. As a result, LLM serving performance is no longer determined by hardware or software choices in isolation, but by their runtime interaction through scheduling, data movement, and interconnect behavior. However, understanding these interactions remains challenging, as existing simulators lack the ability to jointly model heterogeneous hardware and disaggregated serving techniques within a unified, runtime-driven framework.
  This paper presents LLMServingSim 2.0, a unified system-level simulator designed to make runtime-driven hardware-software interactions in heterogeneous and disaggregated LLM serving infrastructures explicit and analyzable. LLMServingSim 2.0 embeds serving decisions and hardware behavior into a single runtime loop, enabling interaction-aware modeling of batching, routing, offloading, memory, and power. The simulator supports extensible integration of emerging accelerators and memory systems through profile-based modeling, while capturing dynamic serving behavior and system-level effects. We validate LLMServingSim 2.0 against real deployments, showing that it reproduces key performance, memory, and power metrics with an average error of 0.97%, while maintaining simulation times of around 10 minutes even for complex configurations. These results demonstrate that LLMServingSim 2.0 provides a practical bridge between hardware innovation and serving-system design, enabling systematic exploration and co-design for next-generation LLM serving infrastructures.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions over structured tables. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable promising solutions to this problem, with operator-centric solutions that generate table manipulation pipelines in a multi-step manner offering state-of-the-art performance. However, these solutions rely on multiple LLM calls, resulting in prohibitive latencies and computational costs.
  We propose Operation-R1, the first framework that trains lightweight LLMs (e.g., Qwen-4B/1.7B) via a novel variant of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to produce high-quality data-preparation pipelines for TQA in a single inference step. To train such an LLM, we first introduce a self-supervised rewarding mechanism to automatically obtain fine-grained pipeline-wise supervision signals for LLM training. We also propose variance-aware group resampling to mitigate training instability. To further enhance robustness of pipeline generation, we develop two complementary mechanisms: operation merge, which filters spurious operations through multi-candidate consensus, and adaptive rollback, which offers runtime protection against information loss in data transformation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that, with the same LLM backbone, Operation-R1 achieves average absolute accuracy gains of 9.55 and 6.08 percentage points over multi-step preparation baselines, with 79\% table compression and a 2.2$\times$ reduction in monetary cost.

Abstract: Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) methods (e.g., HNSW) have become the de facto state of the art for their high precision and low latency. To scale beyond main memory, recent out-of-memory ANNS systems leverage SSDs to store large vector indexes. However, they still suffer from severe CPU underutilization and read amplification (i.e., storage stalls) caused by limited access locality during graph traversal. We present VeloANN, which mitigates storage stalls through a locality-aware data layout and a coroutine-based asynchronous runtime. VeloANN utilizes hierarchical compression and affinity-based data placement scheme to co-locate related vectors within the same page, effectively reducing fragmentation and over-fetching. We further design a record-level buffer pool, where each record groups the neighbors of a vector; by persistently retaining hot records in memory, it eliminates excessive page swapping under constrained memory budgets. To minimize CPU scheduling overheads during disk I/O interruptions, VeloANN employs a coroutine-based asynchronous runtime for lightweight task scheduling. On top of this, it incorporates asynchronous prefetching and a beam-aware search strategy to prioritize cached data, ultimately improving overall search efficiency. Extensive experiments show that VeloANN outperforms state-of-the-art disk-based ANN systems by up to 5.8x in throughput and 3.25x in latency reduction, while achieving 0.92x the throughput of in-memory systems using only 10% of their memory footprint.

Abstract: Modern cloud data warehouses store data in micro-partitions and rely on metadata (e.g., zonemaps) for efficient data pruning during query processing. Maintaining data clustering in a large-scale table is crucial for effective data pruning. Existing automatic clustering approaches lack the flexibility required in dynamic cloud environments with continuous data ingestion and evolving workloads. This paper advocates a clean separation between reclustering policy and clustering-key selection. We introduce the concept of boundary micro-partitions that sit on the boundary of query ranges. We then present WAIR, a workload-aware algorithm to identify and recluster only boundary micro-partitions most critical for pruning efficiency. WAIR achieves near-optimal (with respect to fully sorted table layouts) query performance but incurs significantly lower reclustering cost with a theoretical upper bound. We further implement the algorithm into a prototype reclustering service and evaluate on standard benchmarks (TPC-H, DSB) and a real-world workload. Results show that WAIR improves query performance and reduces the overall cost compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: On-disk graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is essential for large-scale, high-dimensional vector retrieval, yet its performance is widely recognized to be limited by the prohibitive I/O costs. Interestingly, we observed that the performance of on-disk graph-based index systems is compute-bound, not I/O-bound, with the rising of the vector data dimensionality (e.g., hundreds or thousands). This insight uncovers a significant optimization opportunity: existing on-disk graph-based index systems universally target I/O reduction and largely overlook computational overhead, which leaves a substantial performance improvement space.
  In this work, we propose AlayaLaser, an efficient on-disk graph-based index system for large-scale high-dimensional vector similarity search. In particular, we first conduct performance analysis on existing on-disk graph-based index systems via the adapted roofline model, then we devise a novel on-disk data layout in AlayaLaser to effectively alleviate the compute-bound, which is revealed by the above roofline model analysis, by exploiting SIMD instructions on modern CPUs. We next design a suite of optimization techniques (e.g., degree-based node cache, cluster-based entry point selection, and early dispatch strategy) to further improve the performance of AlayaLaser. We last conduct extensive experimental studies on a wide range of large-scale high-dimensional vector datasets to verify the superiority of AlayaLaser. Specifically, AlayaLaser not only surpasses existing on-disk graph-based index systems but also matches or even exceeds the performance of in-memory index systems.

Abstract: All-to-all GPU communication is a critical bottleneck in large-scale training clusters, where completion time is constrained by per-port bandwidth and can be severely impacted by traffic skew across GPUs and network interface cards (NICs). This issue is amplified by the two-tier structure of modern GPU systems, which combine fast intra-server links with much slower inter-server networks. Motivated by recent system observations that highlight the importance of traffic reshaping and hierarchy awareness, we study all-to-all scheduling from an online switching and queueing-theoretic perspective.
  We propose a dynamic hierarchical Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition framework tailored to two-tier GPU fabrics. At each frame boundary, traffic is first balanced within each server using simple local operations to mitigate micro-level GPU/NIC skew while preserving aggregate server-to-server demand. A hierarchical BvN decomposition is then applied at the server level and refined into GPU-level matchings, significantly reducing decomposition complexity relative to a flat GPU-level approach. By integrating this construction with the dynamic frame sizing (DFS) principle, we obtain an online scheduler with provable stability under admissible Poisson arrivals. Simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in mean frame length, particularly under server-localized hotspot traffic.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation directly on encrypted data but incurs massive computational and memory overheads, often exceeding plaintext execution by several orders of magnitude. While custom ASIC accelerators can mitigate these costs, their long time-to-market and the rapid evolution of FHE algorithms threaten their long-term relevance. GPUs, by contrast, offer scalability, programmability, and widespread availability, making them an attractive platform for FHE. However, modern GPUs are increasingly specialized for machine learning workloads, emphasizing low-precision datatypes (e.g., INT$8$, FP$8$) that are fundamentally mismatched to the wide-precision modulo arithmetic required by FHE. Essentially, while GPUs offer ample parallelism, their functional units, like Tensor Cores, are not suited for wide-integer modulo arithmetic required by FHE schemes such as CKKS. Despite this constraint, researchers have attempted to map FHE primitives on Tensor Cores by segmenting wide integers into low-precision (INT$8$) chunks.
  To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose FHECore, a specialized functional unit integrated directly into the GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor. Our design is motivated by a key insight: the two dominant contributors to latency$-$Number Theoretic Transform and Base Conversion$-$can be formulated as modulo-linear transformations. This allows them to be mapped on a common hardware unit that natively supports wide-precision modulo-multiply-accumulate operations. Our simulations demonstrate that FHECore reduces dynamic instruction count by a geometric mean of $2.41\times$ for CKKS primitives and $1.96\times$ for end-to-end workloads. These reductions translate to performance speedups of $1.57\times$ and $2.12\times$, respectively$-$including a $50\%$ reduction in bootstrapping latency$-$all while inuring a modest $2.4\%$ area overhead.

Abstract: With the continuous growth of neural network scales, low-precision quantization is widely used in edge accelerators. Classic multi-threshold activation hardware requires 2^n thresholds for n-bit outputs, causing a rapid increase in hardware cost as precision increases. We propose a reconfigurable activation hardware, GRAU, based on piecewise linear fitting, where the segment slopes are approximated by powers of two. Our design requires only basic comparators and 1-bit right shifters, supporting mixed-precision quantization and nonlinear functions such as SiLU. Compared with multi-threshold activators, GRAU reduces LUT consumption by over 90%, achieving higher hardware efficiency, flexibility, and scalability.

Abstract: Neural network accelerators have been widely applied to edge devices for complex tasks like object tracking, image recognition, etc. Previous works have explored the quantization technologies in related lightweight accelerator designs to reduce hardware resource consumption. However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz).

Abstract: Counting immunopositive cells on biological tissues generally requires either manual annotation or (when available) automatic rough systems, for scanning signal surface and intensity in whole slide imaging. In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images {(providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction)}. Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image. Different numerical experiments with artificial and real datasets show very promising results. Related Matlab code is also provided.

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive sampling algorithm tailored for the optimization of parametrized dynamical systems using projection-based model order reduction. Unlike classical sampling strategies, this framework does not aim for a small approximation error in the global sense but focuses on identifying and refining promising regions early on while reducing expensive full order model evaluations. The algorithm is tested on two models: a Timoshenko beam and a Kelvin cell, which ought to be optimized in terms of the system output in the frequency domain. For that, different norms of the transfer function are used as the objective function, while up to two geometrical parameters form the vector of design variables. The sampled full order models are reduced using the iterative rational Krylov algorithm and reprojected into a global basis. Subsequently, the models are parametrized by performing sparse Bayesian regression on matrix entry level of the reduced operators. Thompson sampling is carried out using the posterior distribution of the polynomial coefficients in order to account for uncertainties in the trained regression models. The strategy deployed for sample acquisition incorporates a gradient-based search on the parametrized reduced order model, which involves analytical gradients obtained via adjoint sensitivity analysis. By adding the found optimum to the sample set, the sample set is iteratively refined. Results demonstrate robust convergence towards the global optimum but highlight the computational cost introduced by the gradient-based optimization. The probabilistic extensions seamlessly integrate into existing matrix-interpolatory reduction frameworks and enable the analytical calculation of gradients under uncertainty.

Abstract: Software engineering (SE) and requirements engineering (RE) face a significant increase in secondary studies, particularly literature reviews (LRs), due to the ever-growing number of scientific publications. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) exacerbates this trend by producing LRs rapidly but often at the expense of quality, rigor, and transparency. At the same time, secondary studies often fail to share underlying data and artifacts, limiting replication and reuse. This paper introduces EmpiRE-Compass, a neuro-symbolic dashboard designed to lower barriers for accessing, replicating, and reusing LR data. Its overarching goal is to demonstrate how LRs can become more sustainable by semantically structuring their underlying data in research knowledge graphs (RKGs) and by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for easy and dynamic access, replication, and reuse. Building on two RE use cases, we developed EmpiRE-Compass with a modular system design and workflows for curated and custom competency questions. The dashboard is freely available online, accompanied by a demonstration video. To manage operational costs, a limit of 25 requests per IP address per day applies to the default LLM (GPT-4o mini). All source code and documentation are released as an open-source project to foster reuse, adoption, and extension. EmpiRE-Compass provides three core capabilities: (1) Exploratory visual analytics for curated competency questions; (2) Neuro-symbolic synthesis for custom competency questions; and (3) Reusable knowledge with all queries, analyses, and results openly available. By unifying RKGs and LLMs in a neuro-symbolic dashboard, EmpiRE-Compass advances sustainable LRs in RE, SE, and beyond. It lowers technical barriers, fosters transparency and reproducibility, and enables collaborative, continuously updated, and reusable LRs

Abstract: Peer review remains a cornerstone in academia, yet it frequently falls short in fostering joint progress and well-being. While peer review primarily emphasizes scientific rigor, it often lacks the empathy essential for supporting and encouraging all peers involved. In this experience report, I aim to highlight that peer review is a practice that demands both scientific care for quality and collegial welfare for the joint progress and well-being of all peers involved, including authors, co-reviewers, workshop or conference organizers, and journal editors. Drawing on my ten years of experience in academia, I propose the ethos of the PEERfect REVIEWer, grounded in the two core values: Scientific care and collegial welfare. Through reflection shaped by professional exchanges with colleagues, consideration of literature, and an examination of both self-authored and received reviews, I formulated an accompanying guideline with 16 practical recommendations to guide reviewers in their actions to achieve these two values. The ethos of the PEERfect REVIEWer and its accompanying guideline help reviewers in upholding high scientific standards and conducting peer review in a constructive, supportive, respectful, and timely manner. They demonstrate that scientific rigor and empathy are complementary forces that promote impactful peer review practice. By placing scientific care and collegial welfare at the core of peer review, this experience report reaffirms the importance of scientific rigor while also advocating for greater attention to empathy. It invites reviewers to reconsider their role not merely as gatekeepers but as partners in the academic journey of each peer involved. The PEERfect REVIEWer is both a caretaker of quality and a steward of joint progress and well-being - as truly impactful peer review practice requires scientific rigor and empathy in equal measure.

Abstract: Code summarization is the task of generating natural language descriptions of source code, which is critical for software comprehension and maintenance. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on this task, an open question remains: can human expertise in code understanding further guide and enhance these models? We propose EyeLayer, a lightweight attention-augmentation module that incorporates human eye-gaze patterns, as a proxy of human expertise, into LLM-based code summarization. EyeLayer models human attention during code reading via a Multimodal Gaussian Mixture, redistributing token embeddings based on learned parameters (μ_i, σ_i^2) that capture where and how intensively developers focus. This design enables learning generalizable attention priors from eye-tracking data and incorporating them into LLMs seamlessly, without disturbing existing representations. We evaluate EyeLayer across diverse model families (i.e., LLaMA-3.2, Qwen3, and CodeBERT) covering different scales and architectures. EyeLayer consistently outperforms strong fine-tuning baselines across standard metrics, achieving gains of up to 13.17% on BLEU-4. These results demonstrate that human gaze patterns encode complementary attention signals that enhance the semantic focus of LLMs and transfer effectively across diverse models for code summarization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As large language models engage in extended reasoning tasks, they accumulate significant state -- architectural mappings, trade-off decisions, codebase conventions -- within the context window. This understanding is lost when sessions reach context limits and undergo lossy compaction. We propose Contextual Memory Virtualisation (CMV), a system that treats accumulated LLM understanding as version-controlled state. Borrowing from operating system virtual memory, CMV models session history as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with formally defined snapshot, branch, and trim primitives that enable context reuse across independent parallel sessions. We introduce a three-pass structurally lossless trimming algorithm that preserves every user message and assistant response verbatim while reducing token counts by a mean of 20% and up to 86% for sessions with significant overhead by stripping mechanical bloat such as raw tool outputs, base64 images, and metadata. A single-user case-study evaluation across 76 real-world coding sessions demonstrates that trimming remains economically viable under prompt caching, with the strongest gains in mixed tool-use sessions, which average 39% reduction and reach break-even within 10 turns. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/CosmoNaught/claude-code-cmv.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based defect prediction models can improve software quality. However, their opaque reasoning creates an HCI challenge because developers struggle to trust models they cannot interpret. Explainable AI (XAI) methods such as LIME, SHAP, and BreakDown aim to provide transparency, but when used together, they often produce conflicting explanations that increase confusion, frustration, and cognitive load. To address this usability challenge, we introduce XMENTOR, a human-centered, rank-aware aggregation method implemented as a VS Code plugin. XMENTOR unifies multiple post-hoc explanations into a single, coherent view by applying adaptive thresholding, rank and sign agreement, and fallback strategies to preserve clarity without overwhelming users. In a user study, nearly 90% of the participants preferred aggregated explanations, citing reduced confusion and stronger support for daily tasks of debugging and review of defects. Our findings show how combining explanations and embedding them into developer workflows can enhance interpretability, usability, and trust.

Abstract: Requirements are inherently interconnected through various types of dependencies. Identifying these dependencies is essential, as they underpin critical decisions and influence a range of activities throughout software development. However, this task is challenging, particularly in modern software systems, given the high volume of complex, coupled requirements. These challenges are further exacerbated by the ambiguity of Natural Language (NL) requirements and their constant change. Consequently, requirement dependency detection is often overlooked or performed manually. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in NL processing, presenting a promising avenue for requirement-related tasks. While they have shown to enhance various requirements engineering tasks, their effectiveness in identifying requirement dependencies remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce LEREDD, an LLM-based approach for automated detection of requirement dependencies that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and In-Context Learning (ICL). It is designed to identify diverse dependency types directly from NL requirements. We empirically evaluate LEREDD against two state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that LEREDD provides highly accurate classification of dependent and non-dependent requirements, achieving an accuracy of 0.93, and an F1 score of 0.84, with the latter averaging 0.96 for non-dependent cases. LEREDD outperforms zero-shot LLMs and baselines, particularly in detecting fine-grained dependency types, where it yields average relative gains of 94.87% and 105.41% in F1 scores for the Requires dependency over the baselines. We also provide an annotated dataset of requirement dependencies encompassing 813 requirement pairs across three distinct systems to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: The evolution of AI coding agents has shifted the frontier from simple snippet completion to autonomous repository-level engineering. However, evaluating these agents remains ill-posed in general code repository generation, where the lack of deterministic ground truth leads to ambiguous metrics. Code modernization via automated translation offers a more rigorous alternative by providing a fixed ground truth -- the source repository; yet existing benchmarks are limited to small-scale repositories and rely on language-specific unit tests visible to the agent, allowing test-driven overfitting.
  We address these limitations by introducing a benchmarking framework for repository-level code modernization built on an implementation-agnostic evaluation paradigm. This framework is instantiated through RepoMod-Bench: a benchmark of 21 real-world repositories with standardized interfaces, spanning 8 programming languages. The benchmark contains 1.6M lines of code (LOC) and 11,616 tests, with repository sizes ranging from 14 to 211K LOC. By targeting repositories with standardized interfaces, we utilize an implementation-agnostic test suite to verify functional equivalence between source and target implementations. This black-box approach ensures verification remains consistent across languages, and our environment hides all test suites from agents to prevent test-driven shortcuts. Evaluating four state-of-the-art agent configurations reveals a sharp scaling collapse: average pass rates drop from 91.3% on projects under 10K LOC to 15.3% on projects exceeding 50K LOC. These results demonstrate that autonomous modernization at scale remains a significant open challenge. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/Modelcode-ai/mcode-benchmark.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Seed explosion is a fundamental problem in fuzzing seed scheduling, where a fuzzer maintains a huge corpus and fails to choose promising seeds. Existing works focus on seed prioritization but still suffer from seed explosion since corpus size remains huge. We tackle this from a new perspective: corpus reduction, i.e., computing a seed corpus subset. However, corpus reduction could lead to poor seed diversity and large runtime overhead. Prior techniques like cull_queue, AFL-Cmin, and MinSet suffer from poor diversity or prohibitive overhead, making them unsuitable for high-frequency seed scheduling.
  We propose RandSet, a novel randomized corpus reduction technique that reduces corpus size and yields diverse seed selection simultaneously with minimal overhead. Our key insight is introducing randomness into corpus reduction to enjoy two benefits of a randomized algorithm: randomized output (diverse seed selection) and low runtime cost. Specifically, we formulate corpus reduction as a set cover problem and compute a randomized subset covering all features of the entire corpus. We then schedule seeds from this small, randomized subset rather than the entire corpus, effectively mitigating seed explosion.
  We implement RandSet on three popular fuzzers: AFL++, LibAFL, and Centipede, and evaluate it on standalone programs, FuzzBench, and Magma. Results show RandSet achieves significantly more diverse seed selection than other reduction techniques, with average subset ratios of 4.03% and 5.99% on standalone and FuzzBench programs. RandSet achieves a 16.58% coverage gain on standalone programs and up to 3.57% on FuzzBench in AFL++, triggers up to 7 more ground-truth bugs than the state-of-the-art on Magma, while introducing only 1.17%-3.93% overhead.

Abstract: The Rust programming language presents a steep learning curve and significant coding challenges, making the automation of issue resolution essential for its broader adoption. Recently, LLM-powered code agents have shown remarkable success in resolving complex software engineering tasks, yet their application to Rust has been limited by the absence of a large-scale, repository-level benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce Rust-SWE-bench, a benchmark comprising 500 real-world, repository-level software engineering tasks from 34 diverse and popular Rust repositories. We then perform a comprehensive study on Rust-SWE-bench with four representative agents and four state-of-the-art LLMs to establish a foundational understanding of their capabilities and limitations in the Rust ecosystem. Our extensive study reveals that while ReAct-style agents are promising, i.e., resolving up to 21.2% of issues, they are limited by two primary challenges: comprehending repository-wide code structure and complying with Rust's strict type and trait semantics. We also find that issue reproduction is rather critical for task resolution. Inspired by these findings, we propose RUSTFORGER, a novel agentic approach that integrates an automated test environment setup with a Rust metaprogramming-driven dynamic tracing strategy to facilitate reliable issue reproduction and dynamic analysis. The evaluation shows that RUSTFORGER using Claude-Sonnet-3.7 significantly outperforms all baselines, resolving 28.6% of tasks on Rust-SWE-bench, i.e., a 34.9% improvement over the strongest baseline, and, in aggregate, uniquely solves 46 tasks that no other agent could solve across all adopted advanced LLMs.

Abstract: Applying LLM-based multi-agent software systems in safety-critical domains such as lifespan echocardiography introduces system-level risks that cannot be addressed by improving model accuracy alone. During system operation, beyond individual LLM behavior, uncertainty propagates through agent coordination, data pipelines, human-in-the-loop interaction, and runtime control logic. Yet existing work largely treats uncertainty at the model level rather than as a first-class software engineering concern. This paper approaches uncertainty from both system-level and runtime perspectives. We first differentiate epistemological and ontological uncertainties in the context of LLM-based multi-agent software system operation. Building on this foundation, we propose a lifecycle-based uncertainty management framework comprising four mechanisms: representation, identification, evolution, and adaptation. The uncertainty lifecycle governs how uncertainties emerge, transform, and are mitigated across architectural layers and execution phases, enabling structured runtime governance and controlled adaptation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a real-world LLM-based multi-agent echocardiographic software system developed in clinical collaboration, showing improved reliability and diagnosability in diagnostic reasoning. The proposed approach generalizes to other safety-critical LLM-based multi-agent software systems, supporting principled operational control and runtime assurance beyond model-centric methods.

Abstract: Context engineering has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) tasks, enabling performance gains at test time without model fine-tuning. Despite its success, existing research lacks a systematic taxonomy of SE-specific context types and a dedicated benchmark to quantify the heterogeneous effects of different contexts across core SE workflows. To address this gap, we propose CL4SE (Context Learning for Software Engineering), a comprehensive benchmark featuring a fine-grained taxonomy of four SE-oriented context types (interpretable examples, project-specific context, procedural decision-making context, and positive & negative context), each mapped to a representative task (code generation, code summarization, code review, and patch correctness assessment). We construct high-quality datasets comprising over 13,000 samples from more than 30 open-source projects and evaluate five mainstream LLMs across nine metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that context learning yields an average performance improvement of 24.7% across all tasks. Specifically, procedural context boosts code review performance by up to 33% (Qwen3-Max), mixed positive-negative context improves patch assessment by 30% (DeepSeek-V3), project-specific context increases code summarization BLEU by 14.78% (GPT-Oss-120B), and interpretable examples enhance code generation PASS@1 by 5.72% (DeepSeek-V3).

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) libraries are widely used in critical applications, where even subtle silent bugs can lead to serious consequences. While existing DL fuzzing techniques have made progress in detecting crashes, they inherently struggle to detect silent bugs due to the lack of effective test programs and corresponding oracles.
  Building on the observation that historical bug reports contain rich, underutilized information about silent bugs, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform versatile yet controlled bug transfer for silent bug fuzzing. Specifically, our approach uses LLMs to extract context-aware bug patterns from historical issues, match semantically related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using functionality-based embeddings, and synthesize test cases with customized oracles. This enables proactive detection of silent bugs by transferring high-risk contexts and oracle designs from known buggy APIs to functionally similar target APIs. To ensure the reliability of our context-aware bug transfer, we introduce an LLM-powered self-validation module that systematically evaluates the validity of each transferred bug instance. We implement this methodology in a tool named TransFuzz and evaluate it on three mainstream DL libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore. TransFuzz successfully discovers 79 previously unknown bugs (12 confirmed as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)) in 10 bug types, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability in migrating DL library bug discovery capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A growing number of publications address the best practices to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages like Python due to their widespread usage training data. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, remains underexplored. This research aims to utilize and integrate LLMs in the industrial development process, solving real-life programming tasks (e.g., generating a movement routine for a robotic arm) and accelerating the development cycles of manufacturing systems.
